Some short chapters filling the 2 week gap between act 1 and 2

Debug and Trouble pick a nickname for Debug, settle on Bug, chat about both having no boob compared to Brun

She also knows it's been a few days and doesn't know how to get the bandages off that are attached to her to change them. Kinda wants company in the shower to help remove them as they become wet.

Debug refuses to let anyone know something is wrong

frank gets a lead on trouble when her and debug go out together and debug says hi to an old friend who's tangentially related to frank's circle
frank gets destroyed when debug's police friend tips them off and gives them ample leverage to destroy frank's life (note, they don't use any official police methods as they have already been shown to be unreliable and able to be abused)
