# Intermission 1
Some short chapters filling the 2 week gap between act 1 and 2

Debug and Trouble pick a nickname for Debug, settle on Bug, chat about both having no boob compared to Brun

Brun talks to Gary about Debug and manages to ask the question poorly enough to get an answer from gary that makes her think Debug is straight and a bit of a lush

Trouble ruminates in her room while working and wants Debug and Brun on hand to chat with and counts down the time till the evening when Brun is coming by. She also knows it's been a few days and doesn't know how to get the bandages off that are attached to her to change them. Kinda wants company in the shower to help remove them as they become wet.

Debug refuses to let anyone know something is wrong
because of social pressures trouble wants to move out of the hotel despite the wonderful care she gets and her friends working there
brun is now more curious about Debug but due to their own stressors they're keeping them at arms length, thus brun tries to self improve and is taken advantage of by Beth
frank gets a lead on trouble when her and debug go out together and debug says hi to an old friend who's tangentially related to frank's circle
frank gets destroyed when debug's police friend tips them off and gives them ample leverage to destroy frank's life (note, they don't use any official police methods as they have already been shown to be unreliable and able to be abused)
