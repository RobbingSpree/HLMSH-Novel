# Situations to put blorbos in

One under reception desk while the other does job (possibly 2 making out while taunting the 3rd at work)

sleep wrong and wake up with pain, require massage to fix, gets steamy

Stuck in a cuddle that turns out to be uncomfortable, have to strip to leave behind the texture they're expecting to sleep on, end up feeling a bit silly now naked amongst sleeping people like a pervert with nothing to do




## for the sequel

Debug wants to try BDSM as a way to face her abusive past in a controlled way
has to convince either Trouble or Brun that it's a good idea

Brun gets a little too hung up on 3 hour foreplay workouts

Trouble is a bit too into lip play and kissing

everyone's trauma makes intimacy difficult, plus some non-trauma reasons

Sinéad tells Debug no one knows who her mom is, and that was why she had insisted they be involved in picking their own name when they were first taken into protective custody and put with a foster family. Cause all her documents taken from her childhood abusers was fake. That was something she had planned to tell her when she was an adult and not bound to Sinéad's house by law.
