Future plot:

Brun stops calling fel trouble and tries to work out a cute name to call Felicity as Debug has warned about using Felicity’s government name around the hotel while she has a stalker boyfriend looking for her

Fel is feeling anxious and goes down to the lobby to find debug and ask for more kisses since the last ones seemed to help. They kiss for a bit and fel notices how turned on she seems and seems bewildered by

Debug tries to check if it's cause she might be a lesbian only to learn her tragic backstory tm and admits they're probably not the right person to talk about that with due to how not serious they tend to be

Debug talks to Brun about it later and reccomends they try giving Fel a kiss so the duty isn't solely on Debug if Fel needs help calming down. Spurred on by fel talking about her thinking she might be ace (debug makes that determination from how fel describes their past experiences)

Brun thinks about the possibility of kissing fel on her own and muses on if she'd like it. With debug's description on asexually fresh in mind she uses it as a lens on herself and contemplates if it fits herself and since in a vacuum she doesn’t think the idea of kissing Fel to calm down her anxiety is sexy she assumes she might be ace also

Confident that a kiss isn't a big thing brun offers to kiss fel if she has anxiety. Fel, not able to say no easily agrees, but has misgivings of being intimate with someone much taller than them, but tries to reassure themself that brun has been a protective force the entier time they've known about one another.

Later that day when an argument seems to break out in the parking lot of the hotel and fel panics thinking Frank might be out there, takes brun up on that offer.

But unlike a kiss with debug that feels playful and friendly brun and fel get hot and bothered and realize after a moment that they had both started trying to undress the other and slipping hands into their clothes, feeling a bit awkward they break the moment and separate

Both reflect on what happened and explore their own bodies a bit, surprised they found someone they can enjoy sexualising activities with and the implications that brings

When Frank is out of the picture for a bit fel starts to relax. Brun leaves them af home to rest while she does a half shift only to come home to fel in the shower, all the hot water spent so it's quite cold. Fel appears to have had a bit of a mental break now she's relaxed and has neglected herself.

Brun turns off the shower and bundles fel into a towel and takes her to her bed to get dry and warm them up.

Taking exposure survival ideas, brun also strips and cuddles fel before covering both of them in a blanket while still trying to dry fel while under the covers.

Fel is crying the whole time.

Fel gets a cold from this and needs to stay home and have Debug and brun care for her while she recovers. She has issues with this as gentle care is difficult for her to accept.
