Felicity Harbor: our maligned protagonist. She had a rough childhood and spent a lot of it in books and writing and pressing flowers as they were all hobbies that could be put away safely and took up little space. Mostly going along with the whims of others they ended up in a het relationship and didn't pursue higher education past high school. They think they're straight, because while they've never really felt loved they've been told that it's normal to have a boyfriend and have disagreements with them so they put up with what was acceptable levels of abuse. It as it has escalated to physical abuse, and then to right before the story starts, threats of lethal violence, they flee their home into the rain when their boyfriend goes to stand on a balcony to have a smoke.

Fastidious and focused, often gets caught in their own daydreams as an escape, easily spooked, disassociates when people get too physically intimate, never screams or whimpers, weaps silently if their emotions are too much. Works as a graphic designer because it earns money, but is a capable artist otherwise.

About 5’ 5”, short hair (as it is fast to clean and dry and quick to fix if assaulted) dull red hair color, grey blue eyes, pale skin with plump lips, sharp upturned eyes, short lashes, freckles (but hard to see at first due to brusing)

Brunhilde Brown: African American, tall and serious. Works as house keeping at the hotel “Lost Shores”, currently doing cross position work to take over from the hotel manager while they're slowly retiring. Has a want to take care of kittens and cats, but their apartment doesn't allow pets. Unaware they're lesbian, has been under the misunderstanding of old gender roles and that they need to be cared for, but due to their stature they don't have any guy treating them that way and guys they have approached don't want to be cared for by them. Sees Felicity as a sad wet kitten that she needs to take care of.

Plans to go to university once they finish being promoted to manager and they have more reliable work hours.

6’ 2” tall, built for sports, hasn’t had time for them, but still has the reflexes, often wears their hair in box braids all gathered up in a bun, braids only just reach their shoulder. gets a short cut later in the story (so we can facilitate running hands through hair better), wears athleisure gear under their work uniform due to powerful thighs chafing

Frank: Felicity’s “boyfriend”, was told they were gifted at an early age and did succeed for a while but stopped putting in effort and felt entitled to results from then on and justified their actions as just being “efficient” as they could get the same results if they put in effort. That bread a cycle of using more and more force to get what they wanted and now they’re a real estate “investor” and agent as their day job. Has bought properties in Felicity’s name as part of a risk avoidance scheme, so at the end of the story Felicity can sell them all to buy the hotel.

Frank has a short temper due to his now mismatched reality between what he believes is possible and what he’s capable of and how that makes him frustrated, but he refuses to acknowledge his failures blaming it on other people.

Frank is described as tall and imposing, but he isn’t shown directly, only ever described or mistaken

Debug: a short, energetic wild child. Has a lot of hobbies and talents, none of which seem to help with their job, but they suspiciously know how to break every rule and which rules are worth breaking. Can pick locks (and is the person on call to get into the room safes if a customer has an issue) and whitles and carves leftover soap left in the rooms into animals or flowers, and comes to work on Rollerblades.

A terrible flirt, but never expects anyone to respond to their advances and just thinks of it as a game. Likes to think they're aloof and emotionally unavailable, is actually just very protective of their heart.

Has an undercut, ebony black hair and knuckles tatoos that read palindrome.

Slightly taller than Felicity, much more so when wearing skates.

Beth: the current hotel manager, likes to be a busy body, older and looking to retire.
