⋆☕️ ˖ ┄───╮
Genre- Romance, Psychological (light)
Word count- 2500
Triggers and page number they appear (if any)- domestic violence, abuse, descriptions of physical harm, death and SA mention
Type of feedback wanted- does the chapter make you feel concerned for Felicity, drop tension when swapping to Brunhilde before ramping back up a bit at the end of the chapter, does the text appear to rush and skip over interesting points or fail to expand on a character's perspective, does it seem like any threads left unresolved are done so on purpose
Any extra information- this is the second from scratch version of this chapter, if need be I'll do it again, so don't worry if I need harsh feedback (I probably have the same opinion that it needs work), don't need grammar or syntax fixes, not worth the effort yet.
