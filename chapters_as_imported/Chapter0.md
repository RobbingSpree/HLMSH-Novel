It was a rough night.

The wind howled outside and rain lashed the walls and windows, easing up every few minutes only to roar back again as the storm continued to surge. Brun stood in the hotel lobby watching the rhythmic waves of rain beat down on the parking lot outside, only visible as the droplets struck the ground. She lent on a mop, staying far enough away from the automatic front door to not trip its presence detection and let the rain in like an unwelcome guest.

Ten minutes prior a paying (and thus welcome) guest had brought in several liters of rain with them and now Brun was waiting for someone else unlucky enough to get caught in the storm to bring more in.

Brunhilde stood quite tall, even though she was slouching over a mop, and had gotten a lot of looks from guests over the years who invented lots or reasons to complain about her stature or tightly braided hair to her boss. Her hands clasped over one another on the end of the mop thinking about the people who while trying to be nice had described her skin tone as walnut all the while Brun bit back retorts and force a professional smile. Gazing past the stray braid at the that had escaped her bun and fell down over her face she saw movement outside.

She had seen a few stray cats and foxes haggard by storms before and it was always a struggle to not go to their aid, but this looked taller than that. As a pair of legs came into the light it was clear this was a person. Buffeted by the wind they stumbled back and forth, clearly making an effort to reach the hotel door. Brun got ready to mop up more rain water, before thinking better of it and turning to walk to the counter so they wouldn't feel as bad about bringing in rain. Brun turned back to face the door again once behind the counter, just in time to watch as the person got within spitting distance of the door only for the wind to change directions and knock them to the ground with a concerning, wet thud.

Moments passed and the person didn't move.

Brun realized she was gripping the counter quite hard. Pops of white blushed over the skin on her knuckles.

The presence detection on the front door finally noticed the guest and it automatically slid open. The wind, now blowing into the hotel brought with it no sounds from the person on the ground. Brun noticed they were face down in a puddle.

Brun then remembered the factoid of how little water someone needed to drown in and strode over to the door.

As she approached she was relived to find this guest wasn't at immediate risk of drowning, their mouth and nose being clear above the water. They had what looked like very wet brown hair, and were wearing a sleeveless shirt and trackpants and sandels, not the kind of clothes one would brave a storm in. Brun now assumed they had been locked out of their house.

And they did seem to be out cold.

The hotel had had it's fair share of drunks and visitors who came in seemingly unable to walk only to lash out at staff who tried to help them, so Brun was hesitant to get too close.

She squatted down to get a better look at the guest's face.

They had taken quite the fall as a lump already looked to be forming on their jaw.

And another on their forehead.

And they did seem to have somehow gotten several bruises from the fall on their arms.

A lot of defensive looking wounds for a single fall into a puddle.

Brun knitted her brow with concern.

The injuries and the clothes combined gave Brun a moment's pause before she scanned the parking lot in case whatever had driven this guest to venture into the weather was nearby, only to see nothing in the gloom and rain.

She reached out and pressed two fingertips to the guest's arm, it was ice cold.

"Don't know why I'm surprised, it's howling out there and you're dressed for the lazing at home." Brun muttered aloud in what she felt was a reassuring tone.

The rain was starting to reach Brun in the doorway, so she crab-walked to the guest's side and lifted them clumsily up and off the ground. They felt like a sopping wet blanket. Their head lolled back and forth as Brun stood back up and walked back inside.

The doors automatically closed once more.

A puddle formed under Brun, her clothes soaking up some of the rain water the guest's clothes were saturated in.

Brun couldn't think of what to do with this person now she had picked them up. They were soaked to the bone, cold and unconscious.

"I guess I should get them out of these clothes..." Brun mused. "The nap room will be empty until the morning shift."

The nap room, as the staff described it, was not much bigger than a broom cupboard. Except instead of shelves with cleaning products it had a chair, a camping cot, a desk phone sitting on the floor, and a full length mirror. The staff used it to get changed into uniform and camp out on quiet nights.

Brun opened the door, the room was illuminated by the lights in the hall, and as they walked in the sensors noticed a person and sprung to life. Brun popped a leg up on the chair to better balance the guest in her arms and started trying to peel the track-pants off them. After remembering they might be tied with a drawstring at the front, Brun began the tedious work of peeling the pants off.

With a wet slap the pants hit the floor. The alabaster legs underneath were marred with even more injuries. Brun had initially been reassuring herself the person had been injured by the buffeting winds, but this seemed more and more like injuries inflicted by someone on purpose.

The guest was still out cold, they seemed dangerously pale and cold to the touch. Brun lay them down on the cot and peeled off their shirt also. She hadn't been thinking much about the person she was caring for, but without a shirt or pants they certainly seemed like a lady who had lost a fight with a homophobic flight of stairs.

"What am I going to do with you, Trouble?" Brun asked, naming the guest the first thing that came to mind. "Ohh, we've got those blankets for fires or whatever."

Brun walked out of the nap room to the office and grabbed the emergency blanket and spent the time walking back working out how to open it and grabbing a roll of hand towels and some single use hand warmers. She patted Trouble down with the hand towels and did her best to dry her hair with the hand towels before draping the crinkly emergency blanket over them and cracking the hand warmers, wrapping them in more towel and setting them under the blanket to keep Trouble warm.

Brun kept checking in on them every half hour and Trouble continued sleeping. Brun didn't know enough about concussions to know if this was something she should be concerned about and planned to wait and see if they woke up in the morning. The blanket and hand warmers did seem to help bring their temperature back up to a safe level. Such that Brun swapped the emergency blanket out for a normal cotton one from the linen cupboard after an hour.
