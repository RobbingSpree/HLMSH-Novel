Trouble let themselves be lead back into the hotel, they felt Debug shifting and looking around as the walked but didn't have the capacity to understand why right now. They felt incredibly drained. It felt like one of the things they had been worrying about almost nonstop the past two days had very abruptly been resolved. 

Were their problems really that easy to fix? 

Had they simply let themselves be abused for so long for no reason?

Were they unworthy of the help they'd been getting

Was this a joke to everyone else?

Did it even count as abuse if it was done to someone like them?

"Oh by the way..." Debug's voice tried to cut through the cacophony of her mind. "I meant to ask you, before we got distracted by the prospect of free time crime, if you knew...Hey Muffin? Are you good? You look real pale." Debug turned the Reception computer screen as she spoke and on it she saw the person she least wanted to.

It felt like all her blood had something better to do and had left. Like someone had bumped her broken arm, but the pain felt disjointed from her body, as though it were somehow being felt a meter or two away from her, and it wasn't pain. It was worse

It was terror.

She wasn't safe.

Nowhere was safe.

Here wasn't safe.

Nothing was safe.

She was going to get hurt again. And soon.

***

It was as though someone had simply unplugged Trouble's legs. They buckled under her weight and pulled Debug down with her. The two women tumbled down behind the reception desk. Tears streamed down Trouble's pale face, her splotchy bruises standing starkly out in yellow and blue. Debug started to panic as she noticed she'd not see Trouble draw breath for an unreasonable amount of time for someone this upset.

Placing her ear to Trouble's shaking chest, Debug wondered how doctors could make sense of the orchestra of sounds a body made. A deep breath did come. Debug pulled back to look again at Trouble's troubled face, just in time to get a face full of heartbroken wailing. Tears flowing freely down her face, and her expression a mask of anguish.

Debug had little experience with this, she knew how to help calm a child. Simple jokes and silly acts could lighten their mood. But such parlor tricks were nothing in the face of this kind of upset. She had simply wanted to end the day with a cuddle pile in a pillow harem.

She cupped Trouble's face in her hands and gently bonked her forehead against the crying woman's, trying to will a good idea on how she could help into existence. 

But all she could think of was the rest and physical closeness she had been carrot-and-stick bribing herself with since she'd got back in the car and started to mentally flag from exhaustion. She hadn't wanted to mention it at the time, but driving back had been a challenge kept alive by furious suspicion that Bee and Trouble would start to make out in the back seat if she drove too slowly. A suspicion founded on nothing but her own feelings of inadequacy and inability to get Bee to look at her with romantic intent.

The noises Trouble was making changed from a wail to a continuous, pained whimper. The quieter noise let Debug feel there was space to hold Trouble closer and shifted her legs to encircle them. She started mumbling platitudes and kind words, trying to vaguely match the volume Trouble was making. Trouble began leaning more into Debug.

Time passed and Trouble made slightly less noise. Debug could feel their noses touching, the buzz of Trouble's whimper tickling her nose. Debug paused for breath and scrunched her face, trying to relieve the itch, only to feel something akin to a string pulling up on her stomach as her lips grazed Trouble's. She didn't know lips could be this sensitive. Without thinking, Debug kissed the crying woman who's face she held.

The complaints stopped.

The kiss was responded to.

With another kiss.

Debug's mind left her altogether as she gently ravaged Trouble's lips with the hunger she'd been teasing herself with all day. Debug didn't know if Trouble was particularly aware what was going on, or if this was even a good idea, but since nothing better came to mind, she pushed forward.

The crying stopped. 

The whimpering stopped. 

Debug felt Trouble's breath hitch a few times as she too was emotionally overwhelmed by the embrace. 

Desperate to sate herself and push forward on an option that seemingly blew Trouble's worries away, Debug's hands slid from cupping her jawline to the back of her head to run fingers through her hair. She felt Trouble's tongue probe her mouth and as though possessed by a spirit of eternal lust: slid her right hand down to caress Trouble's torso and graze her petite breast.

As much as Debug was enjoying herself she did have a problem. She didn't know how to actually break the kiss and be confident she could prevent Trouble from spiraling back into despair so everyone could be put to bed.

Brun looked upon the splendor she had created.

A veritable combination cave and nest of pillows and blankets. She had assumed Debug and Trouble would return while she was building it. But she had managed to complete it without being interrupted. Which gave her a moment's pause and a touch of concern.

Walking to back to the door to Trouble's room and looking down the hallway to see no one nearby gave her more pause. Could they have gotten stuck doing work stuff? Had Trouble fallen asleep in the car? She had seemed quite out of it while they drove back and hadn't responded to questions when they unloaded the car. Brun had sent Debug back to get Trouble and to stop her from building the pillow cave wrong.

An answer as to what she should do next came on the wind, as an anguished wail echoing down the hall. Brun took off at a run, her hair down and blouse half open, but missing the vest she normally wore for work. Debug had badgered her about it while they had retrieved Trouble's stuff, not wanting her to be easily identified as hotel staff. Brun had bit back the retort that Debug was essentially wearing a costume of their boss, but assumed she had thought of that, or was letting her paranoia push her friends around.

Brun arrived at the reception, still not having seen either Debug or Trouble. She crossed the room to the front door to check the car, only to be stopped by an sound she'd not heard in years. A gasp stifled into a second person's mouth.

Her panic for Trouble on pause as curiosity overtook her, what would be a good hiding spot for guests to make out in the reception? Scanning the room until a second noise, this time ruffled clothes, pinpointed her investigation to behind the reception desk? Had they been so impatient to check in, these guests had simply started making out and ducked behind the Reception desk for some privacy?

Brun could see a shoe from where she stood at the front door. Her curiosity mostly sated, she was now at a loss again? Would she bother the couple hidden behind the reception desk and ask if they'd seen Trouble and Debug? Or simply take a peek to remind her what she'd been missing out on by being undesirable? She couldn't ignore the noises regardless of what she chose, and the couple did sound like they were getting more into it as the moments passed.

Lacking any better ideas, Brun rang the reception desk bell and hoped the whole situation would just work it self out once she asked her question.

***

Trouble was lost in the sauce. Her whole body was crying out to be touched. Debug grabbed a fistful of hair and held her close deepening the kiss. But the whole time, her touches were very delicate and deliberate. There wasn't any ambiguity, just clear intent and lust. Nothing mattered more than tuning out everything that wasn't more of what she was getting.

But the song had to stop.

Debug suddenly broke the kiss and stumbled to her feet for some reason. It felt like the terrible noise headphones make when they get unplugged while the signal was live. Her skin felt like it was buzzing, her short hair slowly settling after so much ruffling.

As she came down, Trouble started to sort out her emotions again. The anxiety from earlier wasn't just a bad memory, she literally couldn't remember it properly. That kiss was seemingly so good it took the wind out of her fear. She didn't know if this would last forever, or even very long. But she still did her best to revel in being able to breath and relax everything for a moment.

***

Debug heard the reception bell in her heart. She'd essentially trained a pavlovian response to it in herself. In a moment she lurched to her feet trying to wipe her face and smooth her hair and look professional again. She felt her knockoff bun had essentially fallen out and her hair was a mess.

She was almost relieved when she saw it wasn't a guest. And then she felt like dying instead when she saw Brunhilde's shocked face.

"Is this what you do when it's quiet on your solo shifts?" Bee said, surprise and what sounded like jealousy in her voice. "Do you have a guest back there or a friend? Did they come by just now? Did you check on Trouble like you said you would?" Her voice turning accusatory with the last question.

Debug was at a loss for words. This wasn't simply mischief she could talk her way out of. She had no idea how Brunhilde would take the idea that she was gay, and that she'd laid hands on Trouble.

Debug's mouth opened and closed and no sounds came out.

"Well Casanova, finish that up, check on Trouble and come hang out if you want, or whatever. Or do you want me to go get her?" Bee sounded a bit hurt and Debug's brain started to kick into gear.

"Ahh, she just stepped to the staff loo. I was waiting here...for her to come back and this...happened." Debug lied, not even sure what potential risk she should weigh the lie against. "I can look up her room if I forget, we'll be up in no time." She pressed a key on the reception computer for emphasis, but seeing it wake and show the photo of the man she had asked Trouble about. Debug quickly closed it and put the computer back to its normal starting point, so as not to reawaken Trouble's fears if she saw the screen for where Debug had left her: in a puddle on the floor.

Bee raised her eyebrows, clearly trying to work out what part of what Debug had said was a lie, before walking back into the rooms section of the hotel while muttering.

Debug knelt down and helped Trouble collect and ground themself, taking extra care to touch her in the least sexual ways: gently taking her hand, leading her to pull herself up on the desk, and helping give her hair a quick smoothing so Debug's lies would hold against the barest of scrutiny.

"Are you...done?" Debug asked, trying to avoid directly discussing why Trouble had broken down in the first place. Debug had at least got the answer she wanted. She knew Trouble's past had tried to find her here, but she hoped she had dissuaded them from trying anything further. If need be, with her personal items acquired from her house she'd barely need to leave the hotel so keeping her hidden would be a lot easier.

Debug gently took Trouble by the hand, holding onto her hand with just their finger tips touching. Feeling like she'd far overstepped and was trying to make it up by keeping a distance and giving Trouble space to think.

***

Trouble touched her free hand to her lips, they felt a little swollen from the activity. She looked at Debug's knees while Debug spoke to someone. Her mind was still racing and sound simply bounced off her mind.

Debug had asked her if she was done. Was she offering to give her more kisses if she had another panic attack? She hadn't considered she was actually dating Frank for a long time. They'd long since stopped being romantic. He was like living with a demanding boss. So this couldn't be considered cheating, especially with how he treated her.

She didn't know if Debug had a girlfriend though. She had seen her blush at some of Brun's actions. Did the two of them have something going on? Was Brun getting fulfilling kisses like that when she wasn't looking? Was she jealous of not getting all of Debug? Did she even want that? Could she handle that? Just kissing had been a lot.

Regardless, she knew being this short on sleep and having had such an action packed day wouldn't help her come to a decision.

They reached her room and opened the door to find Brun curled up in the bed. They hadn't actually used it last time they were here, but actually looking it was quite a big bed.
