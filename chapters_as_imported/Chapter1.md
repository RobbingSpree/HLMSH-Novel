With a lurch Felicity tried to sit up in bed. But the bed was a lot harder than she expected so in an effort to try and brace herself she reached out to lean on the furniture only to find air instead of her bedside table and fell out of the cot.

Now quite confused on the floor and with a sore arm as well as a sore everything else Felicity tried to untangle herself from the blanket she was in. It wasn't one she owned. Nor was this room somewhere she knew. Panic gripped her and memories of last night floated into focus.

Se had fled.

Into the night.

It had been raining.

It had been raining quite hard.

The wind had pushed herself around as she ran.

She had almost been hit by a car.

She didn't regret running into the night.

But where could she go in the rain.

She had tried to reach the nearby discount hotel.

And that was all she could remember.

Felicity checked her pockets to find her keys or phone.

She didn't find any pockets.

Nor any pants.

Felicity was naked except for her panties.

She turned about the room trying to take in the situation.

Her clothes were folded and dry on a nearby chair. The room she was in was minuscule, not much bigger than a change-room in a shop. Getting up, her clothes felt warm, like they had been quite recently removed from a tumble dryer or been ironed.

While pulling her pants on, the door behind her opened.

"Morning Trouble. I'm glad to see you awake. Let me get a look at you." A voice she didn't know addressed her. Rough hands gripped her arms and bid her to turn around. Felicity held her shirt against her chest to give her some semblance of modesty, tried to brace herself for a fight, and let herself be turned.

She looked up into the concerned gaze of a stern looking woman. A single braid escaped the bun of braids she had atop her head and ran down her cheek with many more free down behind her. Her skin was a warm brown, contrasting nicely against the stark black of her hair, her smile warmer still.

"I'm so glad I don't have to take you to the hospital and that your condition turned around overnight. It was going to be a challenge trying to explain who you were." The tall lady spoke in a calm voice with a delightful rasp, Felicity felt she could listen to her talk all day and enjoy every moment of it. "You got a name, Trouble? I can't keep calling you that forever."

Felicity didn't answer. She was still trying to remember the specifics of what had happened last night and if there was anything she needed to do immediately to stay safe.

"Hey, Trouble, you with me?" The tall lady snapped her fingers to get attention, Felicity blinked a few times before looking at her again.

"I'm so sorry, last night was a blur, I was trying to remember what happened." Felicity apologized, breaking eye contact and looking down at her feet and began wondering where her shoes were.

"You're not in trouble Trouble, and you're not in danger here." The tall lady gently held Felicity's chin and with gentle pressure had her raise her head again and pulled her to stand at her full height again and began inspecting her face. "But you look like you got tripped into the tumble dryer, so I want to take care of you a bit." The tall lady began inspecting Felicity's arms next.

Snatching her arms free of the gentle grasp, Felicity took a step back. There wasn't far she could flee in a room this small, and the tall lady was standing between her and the door.

"Are you hungry, I can bring you some food while I sort some stuff out?" The tall lady said. She didn't seem bothered by the fact Felicity was barely half dressed.

"No. I'm fine." Felicity lied.

"OK, I'll be back in ten minutes, just stay here for now. I'm going to sort some stuff out." The tall lady said as she stepped backwards back out the door, trying to maintain eye contact with Felicity.

The door closed and Felicity was left alone with her thoughts. She did her best to get dressed and realized that since she had fled the house in her most relaxed attire, she didn't have a bra. If the weather before the storm had hit hadn't been so unethically humid she might have left with more clothes on.

She did have her wallet, since she had said she was "leaving for snacks" as her cover story. She began worrying about what to do next.

***

As Brun closed the door she realized she'd not got Trouble's name, having gotten distracted trying to help rather than listen.

She was going to bring Trouble food though, the shorter lady couldn't be described as athletically thin without lying. When Brun had held her last night and just now it felt like she would break if held too tight. But she didn't smell like someone who'd not been eating, so she must have a lot of stress.

Since she seemed to be sane it looked like a clear enough case to assume domestic abuse and give her one of the rooms held open for people to take sanctuary in.

Walking swiftly, with long confident strides, the way she only did when guests weren't around to see her, she arrived back at the front desk and gave the hotel manager a call.

The phone rang for less than a second before it was answered.

"What's on fire?!" A confused voice on the phone asked.

"Nothing's on fire, Beth."

"Then why'd you call me at......4am? 4am? Gah, I'm not going to be able to get back to sleep now, I might as well come down to the office then."

"Before that, I've got a sanctuary case, can I get approval to give them a room?"

"They seem sane and in need?"

"Concerning bruises, dodges questions, arrived last night during a storm while dressed in lounge-wear. Even if they don't admit it, they need sanctuary." Brun tried to tuck a loose braid behind her ear only for it to immediately fall free again.

"Sure, been a while since we had a sanctuary case. What name are we checking them in under?"

"Trouble." Brun said as she started typing on the reception computer.

"Don't call her that to her face dear, you don't know what she's going through yet."

"No promises."

"OK, I'll send everyone a text saying to play dumb if anyone comes by asking for anyone new arrivals staying here. Is it still raining? Gah. Listen to that pour down out there. Maybe i won't come by the office yet. OK, you're in charge, talk later."

Brun put the phone back in the cradle, noted the room number the computer spat out for where to put Trouble, grabbed the relevant key and headed to the kitchen.

Minutes later, with a hastily assembled fried egg, bacon, hash brown and an entire avocado, Brun returned to the nap room, hoping Trouble had stayed put and she wouldn't need to start a manhunt.

Opening the door she found Trouble near to where she left her, this time fully dressed, with her head in her hands sitting on the cot.

"Morning again Trouble. Are you up for a quick walk? I've got something to show you." Brun beckoned from the doorway, trying to keep the food in her other hand our of view as a bribe in case her ward was hesitant to leave.

Trouble took a few moments to respond, when they looked up it was clear they had been crying while Brun was gone. Trouble stood up and mutely walked over. Rather than leading the way she normally would, Brun wrapped an arm around the smaller lady and lead them up a floor to the room the computer had said.

Noticing she had a distinct lack of hands to open the door with, Brun broke character as an upstanding concierge and hip checked the door so as to get the wireless detector to see the key in her pocket then swiftly kicked the door handle both down and forward to open it before it locked again. Further pawing at the door with her foot to push it all the way open to it's lock position so it would stay open while the pair sidled in.

She found it surprisingly easy to do that whole trick while almost lifting Trouble to keep her close. The plate of food was a greater concern that losing grip on the delicate lady under her arm.

Brun placed the breakfast on a side table and set Trouble down on the bed before grasping her shoulder and lifting her chin with her other hand to get eye contact and popping down on one knee to get almost to eye level.

"Hey..." Brun remembered to try and not call Trouble Trouble but couldn't think of anything else fitting. "Small one." Brun silently reprimanded herself for her inability to pick good pet names. "I'm going to keep you safe OK?"

She could see Trouble not believing her from the way she seemed like she was about to burst into tears again.

"Actually safe, I'm the only person who knows you came here, we've checked you in under a pseudonym so no one can ask after you." Brun realized this might sound like she had planned the perfect kidnapping and tried to sound more reassuring instead.

"My shift's over in ten minutes so I'm fine to just sit with you and do whatever you need to feel content." As the words tumbled out of her mouth Brun realized she actually meant it, she took the room key from her pocket and placed it in Trouble's hands.

Brun did like to be nice to stray cats and other small animals, but didn't think that extended to people. She realized she might have to do some self reflection on this later.

Trouble gently headbutted Brun who took that to mean some for of approval for her to stay.

"I cooked you some food, you should eat because you need to do that to live." Brun leaned back and gestured at the plate of hastily fried foods and accompanying avocado still thinking about if wanting to be this nice to someone in trouble said anything about her or if that was normal.

Trouble mutely reached for the plate. Brun got up and pulled the small table she'd place it on closer. Once the table was in arms length of Trouble Brun got up to grab some utensils from the other side of the room. She hurried when she noticed Trouble looked like she was going to eat the food with her bare hands not wanting the oils to get from Troubles hands to her work clothes.

They sat in comfortable silence for a while as Trouble ate and Brun tried to fix everything she knew about Trouble in her mind.

"Ohh, by the way I'm Brunhilde. You can just call me Brun." Brun interjected into the silence. Realizing while she still didn't know Trouble's name, they also didn't know hers. She was curious if Trouble had given Brun a name as well, but held the question back.

Trouble said something, but it was too quiet for Brun to hear. She shuffled closer to her and leaned in and asked her to repeat herself.

"Felicity" Trouble muttered. Brun, having been awake for 18 hours at this point and just finished a 9 hour graveyard shift, took a moment to connect the dots. Brun furrowed her brow, and tried as hard as she could to overwrite where she had memorized Trouble's name to replace it with Felicity.

"Lovely to hear, Felicity." Brun announced, doing her darnedest to not think the world trouble.

As silence settled back over the room, broken only by Felicity's quiet eating, Brun lay back on the bed, making sure to keep either an arm or leg touching the other woman in an effort to reassure her.

Minutes passed in relaxing silence and Brun jerked awake.

She couldn't sleep here, above all because she was worried Felicity wouldn't be strong enough to move her if she was in the way of her using the bed. She couldn't leave Felicity here either, as she had said she would stick around. The gears spun in her mind until she arrived at what she would later describe as the laziest option.

"I know I just got you settled, but do you want to come back to my place? I'm still in my work gear, so i need to change to nap. And my house has much more comfortable couches and reading nooks."

Felicity's head perked up at the mention of a reading nook.

"Quickly then, before the morning bus fills with business people. Let's go." Brun stood up and offered a hand out. Felicity took it, and the two walked back to the door, realizing she'd forgotten to close it earlier.

It took until Brun stood up on the bus, in anticipation of her stop twenty minutes later, for her to notice Felicity was still holding her hand. They had walked hand in hand all the way through the hotel, donned raincoats and shoes in Trouble's case, and walked out into the, now much lighter, rain. And Brun, almost dozing on the bus, hadn't noticed they were still connected.

Brun changed tact and used their connected hand to offer to help Felicity out of her seat, trying to be as gallant as she could while being this tired. The bus driver slammed on the breaks once they noticed someone wanted to get off, causing Felicity to be thrown into Brun's arms. Absentmindedly Brun stroked the hair of the shorter woman to reassure her while she growled sarcastic thanks at the bus driver.

The two alighted the bus, still hand in hand, and Brun lead them down the street and into a nondescript apartment building. The dawn light heralding the end of the storm following them into the building. Felicity hadn't said much while they were walking, just small agreement noises so far. Brun didn't want to push her to open up and would rather she feel safe instead, but also she wasn't used to people who talked this little. Squeezing Felicity's hand a little tighter she directed her into the building and into the elevator. A short, quiet ride later, they stood in front of Brun's door.

Brun couldn't leave Felicity out in the hall to quickly clean her apartment, that would require letting go of her hand, which she was now feeling quite competitive about once she noticed how long they had already been holding hands. Steeling her resolve Brun opened the door to reveal a short corridor littered with boots and jackets. Brun remembered the huff she had been in the day before having to come back upstairs to grab wet weather gear for her bus ride to work and had thrown clothes and shoes everywhere.

"Don't mind the coats, we had a disagreement about how many I could stack on a single hook before I left yesterday..." Brun's voice trailed off as she realized it might not be a good joke to make to the person who she suspected of being a domestic violence victim. She turned to check what kind of face Felicity was making, realizing she hadn't being paying much attention to her since getting off the bus.

***

Warmth.

Soft relaxing warmth.

First it had been a gentle embrace to guide her to somewhere for her to be safe.

Then warm food.

It wasn't until she started jamming food robotically into her mouth that she realized how much she needed it.

Then a warm hand took hers and lead her out.

On the way outside, Brunhilde had thrown her rain coat over Felicity's shoulders and lifted each leg in turn to slip her feet into slightly too big shoes.

It was brisk outside.

Felicity had threaded her free arm into the coat's arm, but it stayed open at the front and she continued to hold Brunhilde's hand.

It was warm and comforting.

A coat large and puffy enough to engulf her whole body and keep her dry in the calm rain of the morning.

She could feel the callouses of work rubbing against her decidedly softer hands.

When Brunhilde helped her to her feet on the bus, she fought the urge to shout and pull her hand away.

This level of gentleness felt foreign and fake.

Like something she had read about in a far off time and place. Like a promise she assumed would never be kept.

And when the bus suddenly stopped she was caught in the total embrace of the taller woman.

Time stopped.

It had been so long since she had been held like this.

What felt like a minute passed before she remembered the word hug.

And then it ended.

But the feeling hung about.

Like how she would stay warm for a minute after taking off a jumper.

Brunhilde lead her off the bus and into a nearby apartment building. The elevator ride was quiet, Felicity used the mirrored walls to look at the faces Brunhilde was making. She seemed to be conflicted about something. But when the elevator opened she walked out confidently.

She lead Felicity over to one of the doors, paused for a moment while she fished a key out of her pocket and opened the door. Brunhilde said something into the cluttered hallway once she opened the door, but it wasn't loud enough for Felicity to hear.

Brunhilde turned to look at Felicity, a degree of concern on her face. Felicity squeezed her hand and tried to smile at the taller lady.

For now, she felt safe.

This wasn't the house that she had felt trapped and alone in.

Felicity saw the empty set of hooks on the wall and the coats scattered nearby and put two and two together and assumed something was wrong with the hooks. As Brunhilde lead her into the apartment Felicity kept the coat on, not wanting to be a bother and cause more mess with coats in the hallway.

The hallway lead out to a wider room, a combined kitchen, dining, living room. There were three doors against various walls, and judging by the floor she could see glimpses of in each, they lead to some combination of laundry, toilet, bath and bed.

More importantly, in the corner of the room designated for lounging was the comfiest looking chair Felicity had ever seen, flanked by several bookcases.

"Reading nook." She breathed.

"Yeah!" Brunhilde agreed, squeezing her hand in agreement. Felicity was surprised she had heard that. But that was over shadowed by Brunhilde leading her over to the chair, lifting their clasped hands over Felicity's head and causing her to pirouette. Mid twirl, Brunhilde brought their hands down, Felicity caught on to her plan and sat into the chair.

It was just as comfortable as she imagined. She leaned back into it and closed her eyes. Lost in the comfort she was brought back to reality when she noticed Brunhilde was still holding her hand. Brunhilde lifted their joined hands up to her lips, Felicity could feel Brunhilde's breath on her skin.

"Feel free to relax here small one. My collection of books are at your disposal." Brunhilde gestured to the several bookcases, jammed full of books and touched Felicity's hand to her forehead in some sign of respect. "I'm going to have a quick shower and nap. You can wake me if anything is wrong." Brunhilde finally let go of Felicity's hand. It hung in the air for a moment as Brunhilde turned around and strode into one of the adjoining rooms.

Felicity hugged her now empty hand and brought up her knees to add more limbs to the hug.
