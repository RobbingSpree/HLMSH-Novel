Princess looked as the completed cast, trying to think of something clever to write on it while Trouble was distracted listening to the nurse explain the care details for the cast. "I said break a leg" she quickly scrawled.

"A quick question." Trouble asked the nurse, Princess paying attention now her mischief was complete. "I draw and do graphic work for a job. This is my dominant hand, I don't think I can hold a stylus properly like this." She gestured at her own arm, now encased in what Princess had learned was fiberglass and not plaster. The cast covered from just past her first knuckle to just before her elbow and was a vivid blue.

"There's some tricks, but the one I've seen succeed is a ball of clay. Stab the pen through and then build up and shape the clay so you can hold the pen at the right angle but the wrong arm position to what you're used to." The nurse gestured wildly as she continued. "I also knew someone who made a small metal arm they attached to the cast to hold a pen where they normally hold it. Or you can just practice with your other hand." The nurse didn't seem particularly concerned about the issue, but the look on Trouble's face said she was unconvinced.

Princess' attention was caught by the x-ray tech that had taken them into get the scans earlier. They were gesturing to Princess to come over from the doorway and seemed to be trying to stay out of Trouble's line of sight. She excused herself to Trouble and walked out of the room they had spent the last hour in while the cast had been applied.

"The way you've been sticking to your friend the whole time you're here gives me the feeling you're trying to protect her." The tech started as Princess approached, while thinking back and regretting not asking Debug to describe the x-ray tech she knew.

Princess nodded in response, unsure where this was going.

"I just worry that Brunhilde has come to us today and misrepresented her injuries." The nurse continued and Princess' jaw tightened with apprehension. "From the looks of this scan, this isn't a fresh injury. It's got signs of starting to heal. We're very lucky the bones are still aligned and we don't have to re-break the arm." The tech's stern words sounded a bit accusatory.

"Brun's got some...relationship issues she's dealing with." Princess tried to imply more than she said.

"She's also a solid foot shorter than her medical record says she is."

Princess felt the blood leave her face entirely. Her grip on her emotions wavered.

"We..." her voice cracked and Princess took a moment to steel her resolve. "We didn't want to leave any paper trail for her boyfriend to try to use against her or track her down."

"And without a medical record of the issue, filing charges with the police will be harder. There's a limit to what you think will come back to hurt you."

Princess looked down at her hands, unable to meet the tech's eyes.

"Can you tell me what her name actually is, Brunhilde? I assume you had her use your details when you came in?" The tech took one of Brunhilde's hands and continued in a softer tone. "I won't change who this visit is recorded against, but I can put a note in the case details saying it was entered in error under your name so that it can still be used later for police stuff."

Brunhilde pulled out Trouble's wallet and fumbled for a moment, trying to find the ID that had her ward's name on it.

"I just want to keep her safe at all costs." Brunhilde felt a difficult to name mess of emotions mix low down in her guts. It felt like a betrayal to concede Trouble's safety, even if this tech claimed it would be for the best in the long run.

The tech copied the spelling of Trouble's name onto their own arm with a pen.

"B-O-R. Got it. I'll double check this can't be traced if someone tries to search the system. But if you two are known to hang out, you know this might be a place a bad actor would search?"

The tech turned to leave. Brunhilde felt even more conflicted seeing the very name she had tried to keep secret walking away on someone's arm.

***

Trouble looked at their arm bundled up in a cast, testing her fingers to see how difficult it was to move and flex with the restraints around her arm.

Once again, she was walking in Brun's shadow, she had started holding on to the hem of the taller, more gallant woman's shirt. It wasn't that she felt incapable of walking unassisted, rather she felt safe in the shade of her protector and had started using these moments of safety to try and unpack her emotions.

"I don't know how hard this will make working, but..." Trouble started as they crossed back into the hotel's parking lot.

"Love, you don't actually have to help out around the hotel. I assumed you just wanted to keep your body moving somewhat." Brun interjected, her voice sounding chipper again.

The pair had comforted one another as they left the hospital. Trouble felt somehow even more safe, having seen Brun cry, thinking she had somehow made things worse.

"No, Princess~." Trouble tried to tease. "I mean...my real job. The one i do during the week. I draw and do graphic design."

"In an office?" Brun asked looking back under an arm to watch Trouble's face as the answer queued up in her mind.

"No..." The response came as Trouble came to a stop. "I work...remote." The reality of the situation hit her like a truck. She had fled in the night with almost nothing to her name, how could she work? Not lose her job? She was already in debt to Brunhilde and Debug, but to not be able to pay them back at all?

The lights above from the car park were blotted out and she was wrapped up in a warm hug and held against the softer parts of Brunhilde's body.

***

Debug scoffed.

She had seen the pair enter the car park as her second half shift had ended and waited for them to reach the entrance to talk about the suspicious person who had come by earlier. But once they came to a stop in the car park and had what felt like a several minute long hug, she started to feel a rough mix of emotions she didn't want to call jealousy.

Rather than watch through the front doors, still broken after their earlier issue but now simply off, she walked out to meet and disperse the pair.

"'Ello 'ello 'ello, what do we have 'ere? Cavorting with the staff?" She announced in a mock cockney accent.

Bee tried to shoot her a look, but Trouble started trying to extricate herself from the hug and pulling herself together.

"Aww, Muffin, are you okay?" Debug said as she realized it wasn't a fun hug. "Would some crime help?" Debug asked, hoping to pivot into the security camera photos she took of the man from earlier.

"Can you break into my house and steal all my stuff?" Trouble asked, looking like the saddest and wettest kitten.

"Yeah." Debug said flatly. "Doors are just a suggestion and locks a wink and a nod."

"Debug!!" Brunhilde shouted disappointingly.

"Our doors are different." Debug said, backpedaling. "Cause we're outside of them keeping people out. And your room isn't on the ground floor." She conceded, making the noise of a microwave warming something up while she thought. "You've left something at home!" She announced, pointing a finger at Trouble.

"Yeah, I need-"

"A bra!" Debug interrupted before realizing what she had said and slowly collapsing onto the cement. "I'll stop thinking, sorry...just tell me what's going on and I'll listen and not talk." Burning with embarrassment, she focused on what the other two said and the sound of them moving.

"...I do though..." Trouble's voice sounded much closer now. "But I need my work laptop and drawing tools more. I can buy new clothes, but I can't be a bother at work. I don't want them to think I'm unfit for the job."

"Love..." Debug blushed harder still as Bee's voice washed over her. "You've been so helpful today. Can I ask you to help one more time." Brunhilde was clearly cheating, though she didn't know it. Debug couldn't stop herself from cramming her embarrassment deep down and pulled herself back onto her feet.

"OK, you don't have a car, right?" Debug asked, gesturing at Trouble and getting a nod in response. "Great, then they won't expect us to case the joint from one. Let's pile into Abby the abandoned car and head over and see if it's clear to do some light B-N-E!"

"Abandoned car?" Bee asked.

"Yeah, about a year or so ago, some guest got like super arrested or something while staying here and the police forgot to impound their car, so it just stayed in our parking lot." She lead the other two over to the far corner of the parking lot trying to put her previous embarrassment behind her. "So I got Manager Beth to register it, and we use it for running small errands. I think the plan was to put advertisements on it for the hotel, but we don't know much about that stuff. So it's just pie in the sky dreams for now. I've been messing with it cause we don't have the original key for it."

The group arrived at a car that looked as unloved as Debug had described. Chipped paint, covered in dust from a nearby construction, with several suggestions to wash it written in the caked on dust of the windows. Debug pulled out a poorly re-constructed car fob, held together by the unwavering confidence of just enough tape and unlocked the car.

"Trouble, you come sit up the front and give directions." Debug opened the driver side door and slid in.

The car wobbled uncomfortably as everyone piled in.

***

"And...this is the place." Trouble said, trying to scoot back further in her seat and get out of view of any of the balconies of the wall of buildings.

They had pulled up next to a set of adjoining town houses. Some had a tiny front yard, others had put effort into balconies decorated with flags and lights. Trouble had pointed out one that seemed neglected and dull. A few overgrown weeds littered the front yard visible over the front brick wall, the recent rains must have given them everything they needed to flourish.

"Are we looking for a specific car that implies someone might be home?" Debug asked, scanning the claustrophobic street.

"Maybe I go out and look through a window?" Brunhilde said as she unbuckled and slid into the middle spot of the backseat.

Debug turned back to look at her with a frown.

"I don't want to say 'this is a white neighborhood that'd call the cops on you' buuuuuuuut..." Debug gestured at the houses along the street and made a face that tried to finish her sentence.

"I don't see any sign of his car...but it's always a bit hard to find parking along here cause it's too big" Trouble seemed very on edge. Not knowing if she'd be open to reassuring touch, Brun gave Debug an audible pat on their shoulder instead.

"So we have no way of knowing if someone's inside unless we check?" Debug asked, Brun had no answer to that, but also had no answer as to why Debug appeared to be blushing up to her ears. "Well...scream if the cops turn up or I get murdered so I have time to escape." Before opening the car door and climbing out.

Brun watched as Debug confidently walked across the street.

Fumbled in her pocket for what looked like keys.

Reached the door and from their perspective tried turning the handle twice before opening the door and walking inside.

"She was right" Trouble announced from the front of the car. "That lock did nothing to stop her." The pair sat in stunned silence unsure of what to do with the new knowledge.

Their silence was broken when Debug reappeared at the door again gesturing them to follow.

"I...don't...know...where...your...stuff...is." Brun translated from what she saw Debug mouthing from across the road.

Trouble felt incredible unease. She had thought she would never set foot back in this house again. The effort it had taken to finally put her well being first and leave, to open the front door, see the terrible storm gathering overhead and feel confident it was worth risking to escape.

She lead Debug and Brun through the cramped house point to specific items and taking instructions mechanically.

"If I'm not around to break in again and to remove evidence we'll need a key, do you have a spare?"

"You've been wearing my rain coat a lot, do you have a comfortable jacket we can nab? Maybe a bra too?"

"Work laptop, drawing tablet, stylus, check."

"Do you have a folder of important documents, Love?"

"Want me to kill the TV so it never works again?"

"And shoes, do you have another pair? The one's you've been wearing need way more time to dry after absorbing an entire puddle the other night."

"I left the freezer door open a crack so everything in there defrosts."

"Debug also said to grab your phone, but to turn it off."

"Sadly we can't ogle you anymore, I found and raided your underwear drawer."

"Can we stop for a coffee on the way back to work?"

"And that's ten minutes, I don't want to push our luck so anything we didn't grab we don't need." Debug started ushering Trouble and Brun out of the house, across the street and back into the car. All their loot filling the front passenger seat and Trouble now sitting on the back with Brun.

It felt unreal. Like a one of those roller-coasters that seems determined to kill one more passenger before being condemned, she was fully expecting things to go sideways and someone, very likely her, to end up hurt. But without the comeuppance hitting, it felt fake. She felt fake.

She sat in stunned silence for what felt like half an hour, but could have been any amount of time. Her solitude was broken when she felt a hand on her thigh. Blinking away what she was surprised were tears, Trouble turned to see Debug crouching outside the car and leaning on the open door.

"Bee said we'll be making a pillow fort and all piling into your room until you get to sleep." Debug mumbled. "Do you want to stay out here in the car a little longer, or want to come in with me?"
