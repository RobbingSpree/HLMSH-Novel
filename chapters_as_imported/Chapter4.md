Brunhilde lead Trouble into the Hospital's Emergency Ward with a plan.

As part of their ongoing effort to not leave any traces of a person Trouble's boyfriend could track down, and since the ID they'd need to use at the hospital didn't have a photo on it, Trouble would pretend to be Brunhilde while she got treated.

Trouble was walking right behind her, rearranging Brun's wallet so it's contents were in spaces that made sense to Trouble. As per the advice of Debug, who they'd called again while they were on the bus asking for advice on how to commit this sensible case of identity fraud. Debug had said a few offhand remarks today that made it seem like she knew how to do crimes and simply didn't due to a lack of a good excuse, and her advice being so obvious after the fact made this seem true.

From behind her a quiet voice chimed in, breaking her focus.

"Your last name is Brown?"

Brun turned to look into Trouble's big eyes. She had a face that Brun would best describe as a chronically unloved kitten, a kitten she felt an incredible urge to protect. Her normally sarcastic comments about her name and how it seemed like a cosmic joke at her expense died in her throat.

"It's a bit on the nose, eh?" She turned back to watch where she was going, mostly to not confuse Trouble with the smile that was fighting to spread. "It'll be a good change one day when I get married and get to pick a new name."

"I don't think Debug is married..." Trouble piped up again. "And that can't be the name they were born with. Maybe you can just change it yourself. I thought I had someone else's ID for a moment when I saw "Felicity" on mine earlier. You've been calling me Trouble so much, that Felicity does seem to fit me anymore, I forgot what my own name was."

"Well, once its safe to spend hours in the local government building doing paperwork, we'll make a day of it. Change our names to something fitting." Brun did her best to talk to the woman hiding in her shadow. "But for the rest of today, you're Brunhilde and I'm...?" Brun paused as she tried to come up with a fake name to use while Trouble 'Borrowed' hers.

"Princess?" The quiet voice behind her suggested.

"I...I have to know what train of thought lead you to that." Brun said as she stopped and turned to face Trouble.

"You've got a bit of a regal air to you, like a confidence to lead and a duty to protect." Brun could see a blush appear through the bruising and suspected there was more she wasn't saying.

"Sure, I've got no better ideas, so I'll try answer to that for now." She walked behind the shorter lady and lead her the last few meters to the Emergency Care entrance.

Princess lead Trouble into the cramped room. Chairs sat in clumps around the room, a batch of them near the entrance all had people in some amount of discomfort sitting in them and a few of the other batches had one or two people sitting in them.

Trouble concluded it must be a sorting system so the nurses could tell how many urgent or serious cases were still left at a glance.

She was steered to the front desk and a receptionist looked up from a crossword as she approached.

"My friend Brunhilde might have broken her arm in a fall yesterday in the storm." Princess said from behind her, in a voice the fake Brunhilde recognized as her customer service voice.

"Yeah, that's been a lot of the issues we've had recently. Take this form and fill it out and bring it back when you're done, sit over there while you do." The receptionist pointed to a patch of chairs where no one was sitting in while handing a clipboard with some forms attached.

Princess guided her over to the chairs and tried to help her sit. She had been even more protective once she'd found out Trouble had something more concerning than her collection of bruises. However, with more actual touching, Trouble was finding her bruises did actually hurt when touched, just not when she was gingerly probing herself. But she couldn't bring herself to tell Princess they were doing more harm than good.

Princess took the forms and started filling them in, Trouble taking out her borrowed wallet and grabbing the relevant cards to answer the questions; even though Princess already knew the answers. Trouble noticed as she fished the various cards out just how much she had been relying on her non-dominant hand to avoid using her injured arm.

Trouble tried to make a mental note to ask Debug how she had so much advice for doing fraud at the drop of a hat, and then remembered she had managed to forget breaking her own arm so doubted that she could actually remind herself later.

Trouble felt a gentle poke to her cheek.

"Do I have your attention now?" Princess asked, with her other hand threatening to draw on Trouble's face.

"Sorry, I was just thinking about Debug, she's quite mysterious and I want to make sure I don't put my foot in my mouth trying to thank her later by prying into why she knew all this stuff and..." Not knowing what to do with her hands or how to stop rambling Trouble gently bit the wallet she was holding.

Princess put the clipboard down in her lap and gently pulled Trouble into a side-on hug.

"That's not today's problem. You thought of it now, you can think of it again. There's very little limits on when you need to thank someone." Princess slid her hand that held the hug up Trouble's body and tried to gently run her fingers through Trouble's much shorter hair, causing Trouble to flex lean into the touch.

A soft happy noise escaped Trouble without her notice.

"We'll get you treated and pop back to the hotel so you can nap. I'll get you a harem of pillows to build a nest from." Princess cooed into Trouble's forehead.

The pair lent into one another and sat in the quiet hubbub of chatter and complaints of the ER.

***

Debug was starting to regret her choices. She had called Manager Beth for help when she started trying to doze off on her feet at the front desk. Talking Bee and Trouble through how to avoid leaving a paper trail had brought old and unpleasant memories back to the surface.

As she stood, subtly sitting on an upturned broom doing slightly complex maths to stay awake, the front doors opened. Debug looked up to see no one in the entry and no one outside.

Her hackles raised and she felt herself bristle with concern for her own safety.

She knew those doors had an unhelpfully close depth of view meant either someone was playing silly buggers, or someone had a way to beam infrared light at the sensor to see inside without approaching. Debug had done the latter in the past when they'd had to take deliveries through the front door after the back got damaged by a drunk guest and had gotten very bored of needing to stand near the door to keep it open.

Squinting at the cars in the distance at the road, trying to see if any of them looked occupied or windows open.

Minutes passed in a focused standoff between Debug and the world outside the hotel. The door's mechanism making a sad noise every twenty five seconds as it tried to time out and close only to detect 'something' and return to fully open.

Debug tried to remember how many of the cars out at the road she could remember from her two walks through the car park today. A few with obvious marks she could remember, the grey car with the home made decals, the red with the mounted wing mirror, the black with the paint burnt away from animal or tree droppings.

A ute.

A blue ute.

The passenger window was down a crack, it stood out in a way she would have made note of it and its fish out of water status for urban driving.

Minutes later, her assumptions gained credibility.

The front passenger door opened and a gruff looking man came out. In the moments as he got out Debug could barely see an empty driver's seat. Their fight or flight instincts kicked into fight. This might be the dirtbag who'd hurt Trouble.

The man began striding through the car park.

Debug looked down and noticed they had grabbed a pen and were holding it in a very tight fist. Memories tried to surface about how to use it in a fight. She stamped her foot and tried taking calming breaths. Regardless of if this was who hurt Trouble, they hadn't hurt Debug and she was safe for now. Getting too riled up would only mark her as an enemy, and being invisible and forgettable would be more useful for now.

Knowing there was little time, Debug tore her name tag off her uniform, mildly stabbed herself getting Manager Beth's spare badge stuck into her clothes. They pain centering her and helping her focus. She changed her loose ponytail into a tight bun mirroring Beth's normal work look. Her hands tugged and pulled at her shirt and vest to make herself look more presentable.

The sound of booted footsteps announced his arrival. The door was still open and made one more sad noise before the suspect entered the hotel lobby.

"Excuse me, my friend said they were staying here, do you mind if I leave them a message as to where we're eating tonight? Or can you call their room to pass on the message if they're in?" The suspect said in a polite voice Debug didn't trust.

"Certainly." Debug lied. "Do you mind telling me their surname and which room they're staying in?" Trying to gently have them show more of their intent by appearing compliant? She woke the computer in front of her by striking the corner key of the keyboard, the light from the screen adding unflattering shadows to her face.

"Ohh, they didn't mention which room they're in. And they left their phone at my house when they visited so I can't call them to ask. I was hoping you'd be able to pass that onto them for me too."

If this was the guy, he must have tried other places first, or this wasn't his first time searching for someone who had fled him. Suspicion rose up in Debug. If she took the phone, even if she told him nothing else, it was confirmation that Trouble was here.

"Certainly, if they're here." Debug gently pushed back. "Can you tell me their surname and I'll look them up in our system." She knew none of Trouble's details were in the system so a search would come up empty. Or worse, an unhelpful partial match with a real guest.

"Felicity Harbor. We're eating at the family restaurant in town called The Gathering, and you'll give her her phone back." The man slid the phone onto the counter between them.

Debug realized, after a moment of cross checking that name with the guests she had checked in recently, she didn't actually know what Trouble's legal name was. So even if she wanted to she couldn't know for sure if this guy was 'the guy'.

Breaking eye contact to watch herself touch type Trouble's possible non-pseudo-pseudonym. Before turning the screen around to show the man, who had already placed the smart phone on the counter expecting Debug to take it.

"We don't have anyone under either of those names at the moment." Debug said, talking slowly to hold back a grin. "Are you sure they said they were staying here, sir?"

Debug watched the man lose his composure for a moment and frantically scan the screen for any info. Debug had chosen a filter rather than a search so bad matches were removed from view rather than just organized to the bottom of the list. She wanted this guy to get nothing that he could use to follow up that wouldn't expose him to a trespass or loitering charge.

"If you don't have anything else I'll have to ask you to vacate the premises as our facilities are for guests only." If this guy wasn't the guy, Debug might feel bad about taking glee from his failure to find a supposed friend.

The moment of silence that followed was broken by the automatic door making another sad noise as it's sensors prevented it from closing. Debug could feel her heartbeat in her eyes, her whole body was on high alert, her customer service face doing it's best to stay in place.

Debug hoped that since she'd preemptively shutdown all his attempts to press forward he couldn't get angry and would have to leave. She hoped he wouldn't try to escalate.

But a look he was getting on his face suggested otherwise.
