It had been a very long time since Brun had shared a bed with anyone. And the sounds of Debug making out with someone behind the reception desk haunted her dreams. As she faded into sleep, she was bombarding herself with questions.

Was she a good kisser?

She'd not mentioned a boyfriend or any kind of romantic partner before, right?

Was she the kind of woman who's hook up with strangers?

They'd worked together for years, but because of Brun's hangups on her previous relationships she'd always avoided talking about anything romantic or sexual cause thinking about it too long put her in a depressive funk for a week.

Brun was a vigorous sleeper, and moved a lot in her sleep.

***

Trouble was in it now. She'd spent a while thinking about why kisses had seemingly done such a good job of helping her get out of a panic attack instead of sleeping. Maybe it was just something so loud in her senses that it drowned out the choir of panic in her mind?

She finaly tried putting that aside and getting to sleep after musing on it and resolving to ask Debug for another kiss tomorrow to compare if a second one was as good as the first. For science, of course.

Trouble was roused before getting all the way to sleep by a pained noise coming from Debug's direction. She opened her eyes and as she attuned to the darkness saw the woman – who had given her so much today – weaping. She felt a little uncomfortable watching her. She tried to rouse the sleeping Debug only for her to snatch Trouble's hand before holding it to her chest like a reassuring blanket or toy.

Through Debug's shirt, and the bra she had gone to sleep in, Trouble could feel an erratic heartbeat. She tried to shift her hand a bit to free her thumb so she could caress her captor with it and give her some reassurance through her dreams. Trouble was laying on her side, so her bottom arm was trapped and couldn't be used to help for now.

Trouble didn't have time to shift to get her arm free; however, as Brun's arm that still was draped over her suddenly moved. Brun had gone to sleep with a polite distance between them in the bed, but while asleep she must have confused Trouble for a loose and huggable pillow and was trying to pull her closer to snuggle right up against.

She tried to shimmy and wiggle further away, but the much stronger woman would simply gain ground and pull her ever closer any time she raised her torso to wiggle away. After about a minute of losing that fight; she was snug up against the taller woman, who proceeded to nuzzle into the crook of her neck. Causing a spark of excitement and arousal to reignite in Trouble, which was not helping her get to sleep in the slightest.

If that had been all; Trouble would have been able to eventually get to sleep. But Brun started mumbling in her sleep, speaking directly into Trouble's skin and tickling her with her surprisingly plush lips. Trouble pulled her bottom arm free and flailed, wrapping her arm around herself to put her hand between Brun's face and her neck.

Brun kissed the back of Trouble's hand.

Trouble was actively fighting herself to not make any noise. At this point, she didn't have a reason as why she didn't wake either woman assailing her up. A mix of shame, embarrassment, and excitement prevented her from thinking straight.

Brun wasn't done. When Trouble had flailed earlier, she'd knocked Brun's hands holding them close away, down to her hip. Brun's hands slid back up Trouble's body to where it sat before, but this time it snuck under her shirt. The sensation of her normally gallant friend's hand on her bare skin was the tipping point.

A sound of unknown origin escaped Trouble's lips and her hips pressed back into those of the taller woman with an unknown need.

Debug seemed to disagree with how far Trouble had moved and scooted towards her, burying Trouble's trapped hand and forearm in her cleavage. Once she'd finished her approach, Trouble found herself in the crook of someone else's neck.

A thought that surprised Trouble passed through her mind. She should look into what kind of career opportunities pillows had.

Brun woke up a little damp. She had built the pillow nest with enough space for everyone to have their own chunk of the bed to sleep on, but over the course of the night, somehow everyone had ended up snuggled up into a corner of the bed with her jammed the into the corner. All these pillows and blankets she'd requisitioned from the linen closet had acted like a great thermal insulator; and with the extra warmth from her friends, she'd managed to sweat quite a puddle.

A wet blanket was a force strong enough to spur Brun onwards and upwards, rolling out of the bed and clean onto the floor. She felt far more rested than after her normal rushed few hours of sleep.

With incredible willpower, Brun managed to climb up the bed and force her legs to bear her own weight. She stretched to banish the remaining sleepiness from her mind and body. Her gaze fell on the two women still in bed.

They seemed to have ended up in quite an intimate embrace. Trouble had her arm around Debug's hips and Debug seemed to have nestled her face into Trouble's hair. Was Debug actually amazing at getting action? Had she been overlooking a master out of her
