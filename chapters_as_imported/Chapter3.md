Felicity felt like a balloon tied to Brunhilde's wrist. She bobbed around nearby as they walked the hotel's corridors helping Brun with her shift.

She had tried to stay focused and pay attention when they had entered the lobby and Brun had introduced her to the other staff. They had said kind words and been quite welcoming and accommodating, but the entire incident drifted straight out of her brain as her thoughts veered back over how her and Brunhilde had spent the last half a day together and if she was behaving appropriately and if she was putting her at risk by spending more time together.

"Brun must think I'm like a lost puppy or something." Felicity muttered to her phone as she pretended to take a call at a window while Brunhilde talked to some paying guests. She pulled the raincoat she was wearing closer, as though keeping herself safe from the cold. Brun's coat magically keeping herself from spiraling in self loathing thoughts with the memory of the hug she got yesterday. Luckily the weather had stayed chilly since yesterday's storm, allowing Felicity to keep wearing Brun's coat and keep her uncovered arms and unbound chest from the curious gaze of the other guests.

No one was giving the bruises on her face much of a second glance, as apparently a lot of other people had gotten caught out in the storm and caught various fresh injuries trying to stay upright and not get battered by debris.

Brun finished talking to the other guests and busied herself for a minute fixing up some nearby blinds while the guests walked out of sight before turning back to Felicity.

"I'm due for my next meal, wanna come down to the Nap Room and we'll have some snacks? This time it'll be real cooked food~" She tried to appeal to Felicity with a singsong teasing voice. "None of that cereal masquerading as home cooking."

Felicity smiled in response, letting her fake phone call end and hand fall to her side. But her smile didn't stop and grew broader. She felt a warmth in her tummy, and very quickly panic rose up to cover it. Without thinking, Felicity turned to lean against the wall, letting the hood of the jacket hide her face as her smile quickly shifted into a grimace, her stomach clenching uncomfortably as a reflex. She clenched her teeth, stopped her breathing, and tried to keep her chest still as the urge to cry rushed over her like a wave.

It took a few seconds to control her emotions again, and Felicity pushed off the wall as though nothing had happened. Letting a sigh escape while she tried to relax her body. Brunhilde came up and placed hands just below Felicity's shoulders and lead her downstairs to where they had first met.

Felicity spent the whole walk doing her best to maintain normal sounding breathing and a neutral face as Brunhilde steered her from behind.

***

"I hope she doesn't have any dietary requirements. I've just been feeding her junk and a single fruit." Brun muttered to herself as she grabbed herself and Trouble some of the dishes being prepared for the guest's dinner from the kitchen; nodding to the chefs as they finished the work on desserts. "I want to think I've been doing good, but she's so quiet all the time. I just have to guess."

"I know its not a walk in the park. I'm doing my best to only touch where I know no bruises are." Talking to both herself and the expressionless chef across the bench from her dicing mango after mango who wasn't listening. "I don't want her to feel trapped, but I also want to keep her where I can see her and make her day better. Am I doing this wrong?" The chef looked up, tuning in only for the last bit of her monologue.

"Yep. Me and yer therapist have been talking about yer self doubt and we think you need to stop questioning yerse'f." They joked. "...also don't ask me, I've been awake for 20 hours and want to burn my shoes in the river." Before lobbing some apples at Brun.

Moment later Brun strode down the staff corridors to the nap room, a plate filled with food in one arm and the apples in the other since they kept trying to roll off. She kneed the handle to the nap room up and shunted it open with her leg, meeting Felicity's eye before gently lobbing the fruit to her right side.

Felicity snatched the fruit from the air in a single motion with serious dexterity only to wince, drop the pair of apples and catch them just before hitting the ground with their other hand.

"Very swish. I'm impressed." Brun said as she folded herself down into a cross legged pose on the floor and put the plate on the chair nearby. "I bring sustenance."

As they ate, Brunhilde tried to make small talk while keeping what she thought was a subtle eye on which hand Trouble was doing stuff with. How she favored her right hand for most eating, but kept switching back and forth between left and right for anything that required dexterity or if she needed to do anything at odd angles like cut cheese. Also the meat, which she had saved till last wasn't as warm anymore and required a bit of a solid grip to pull on the bone while she gnawed at the meat and Trouble would swap to her left to do the harder work.

Brun frowned and decided to press the troubled lady. "Trouble love, I've been meaning to ask. What sort of bumps and bruises do you have? I just want to make sure I don't try to help only to poke you square in somewhere delicate." Trouble's face flushed pink for a moment before she swallowed and mumbling started to take off the rain coat.

It took a few moments before Brun realized she was staring. Trouble's delicate hands with long fingers, her wiry arms with the hint of muscle tone to them. The bruising marring the pale colour looking a lot angrier since she last saw them. Remembering the context she last saw Trouble's arms Brun's eyes flicked to her chest before with herculean effort looking anywhere else and settling on Trouble's face. They held eye contact for a few seconds before Trouble broke and looked away.

"I mean...I've got a few bruises from some fights I got into." She said as she examined her own body, giving some of her bruises a gentle poke to test how sore they were, pouting at some of them as she paid them attention. "But this isn't that bad, you've not done anything wrong."

Brun moved from a cross legged sit into a kneel, leaning forward and reaching out to her ward, touching her skin gently. Treating Trouble's pale, bruise-splotched skin like a museum exhibit she was trying to avoid touching and ruining.

"Trouble...I can make mistakes. I can do the wrong thing. We've only just met and I might say something or do something that hurts you. I need you to be honest and tell me if I do." Her hand trailing down Trouble's right arm, skirting the bruises and coming to an especially yellow bruise her wrist. "You've been favoring your right hand all afternoon when you've been helping. But if you need to hold anything heavy you use your left. And just before when I tossed you those apples, you acted like you'd made things worse. Did something happen to your arm?"

Her questions had an obvious implication, but neither wanted to make any accusations. Brun kept reminding herself to use the passive voice, pretending no one has caused an injury but they sure were here.

"No I...its from work, I think. I do graphic design and digital art...and drawing and using my computer all day I get wrist pains sometimes. This is my fault. I did..." As Trouble's words started to get panicked Brun placed a finger to her trembling lips, caressing her cheek and neck in the few spots without bruising.

"Love, its ok. You don't need to explain to me. I don't mind. I just...I want you to be safe, and if that means I try to be gentle with your right hand." Brun's other hand was still holding Trouble's wrist, moving to gently cup her hand. "Are you sure this is just Whats-a-thing Tunnel? The artist problem? You've not taken a fall recently...like the other night...in the storm? Just fallen poorly on your arm? You saw today how many other people had been hurt in the storm. Maybe we go to the hospital and get you checked?"

Brun's hands slid back down Trouble's wrist. Gently holding the bottom of her forearm. Brun watched as while Trouble's face that was impassive, she swiftly began to sweat. Her face going deathly pale, the bruises becoming starker on her skin.

Brun began to panic.

***

Felicity had been confident it was just carpal tunnel issues. The weather had been quite cruel to someone with joint issues, swinging back and forth from high pressure to low, from hot and humid to cold and sharp. But as the two of them sat there, nothing but the weight of her own arm pressing down into Brunhilde's careful fingers, Felicity felt a deep sense of something being wrong.

It wasn't pain, this was worse. Like screaming with no voice, sound or air. Like a feeling so loud and intense, her other senses were prickling and picking up on it. She felt like she might faint, like she needed to go to sleep right this minute.

Years of treating her wrist with caution had accidentally hidden a different problem. Was this new? Had she gotten herself hurt at home? Did she fall in the storm and do this? Had her work made her more vulnerable to this injury? Could she even work like this? Mind racing with questions.

It took Felicity a moment to notice Brunhilde was talking to her. The pain was gone, but a terrible tenderness had followed it. Like a bright sign that said "problem" sat in her mind. Brunhilde's hands were on her face, cupping her cheeks and wiping tears she didn't realize were flowing away.

"Trouble, you with me? You OK, love? I'm sorry if I hurt you. This is exactly what I thought I'd do. I'm too cumbersome and brutish. I don't want to hurt someone as lovely as you." Felicity touched Brun's face in return, her own silent flowing tears running down tanned her cheeks.

"I'm ok, that just...came as a surprise. I don't think that's Carpal Tunnel or an RSI. That was...something else." Felicity's voice came out rougher than normal. "I don't know what to do..."

***

Brunhilde's mind raced. She was built like a brick and rarely, if ever got hurt. She couldn't fathom what was wrong. She had touched Trouble's wrist several times, but the last time had somehow almost made her faint? Like an off switch for a person, even though she only grazed it how was that bruise any different.

In a flash, she thought of someone who would know.

"I've got a friend, one of the other concierges. I introduced you to her as we came in and did the handover."

"I don't think I was entirely awake for that somehow. I know you tried to introduce them...but I barely remember much of that whole bit. Actually, I barely remember the bus ride here too." Trouble frowned, colour starting to come back to her face.

"Anyway, Dee, my colleague, is built like a brittle puppy. She's got a lot of experience with injuries. Give me a sec I'll give her a call." Brun dug into her uniform and pulled out a cheap looking flip phone and ran through menus to start the call.

"Won't she be asleep? You were out almost as soon as we got back to your place."

"Nah, her sleep schedule is a mess. She's always awake, or sleeps really lightly." Brun's phone started buzzing with dial tone. Moments later the buzzing stopped stopped, and a voice spoke.

"Hey Bee, did the front desk computer die again?" A gruff voice came through the phone.

"I call you for other reasons Dee. In fact...got a question about an injury. You get hurt all the time, thought you could help work out what's wrong." Brun spoke as though there was a third person in the room, gesturing with her free hand and sitting back to give Felicity some space.

"Rough way to phrase it. But...I'll allow it. Describe what's going on."

"Right, so...if I touch them on the wrist, they seemed like they want to faint. But other times when I touch the same sort of area nothing happens. Otherwise its a bit hard to use the arm I guess...anything to add Trouble?" Brun turns the phone to Trouble.

"It feels very loud...and very wrong, like I need to give it a lot of attention." Trouble's voice was a bit quieter since the call started.

"Phh that's easy. Broken bone. Probably a fracture, not a bad one. If you push the bits of bone apart at all the body gets really upset. That's a hospital visit for sure. Want me to recommend one? I know a girl in radiology who likes me." The voice over the phone was surprisingly cheerful for a serious prognosis.

"Hospital...I...we can't go. I said I'd take care of her. And I've still got half a shift left." Brun instinctively looked at her watch, though it told her nothing new.

"I can cover for you. I already got all my sleep in for the day. Plus, I've got something I'm saving up for, so nabbing an extra half shift from you will push me into overtime for this week. I'll start walking and meet you at the front desk in say...15 minutes?" A lot of jostling and ambient noises suddenly came through over the phone as it sounded like the person on the other end pushed their phone through a jacket sleeve.

"I'll owe you any favor for this. You're too nice to me, love." Brun started gathering the plate she had brought in, handing the apple Felicity had set down back to her before giving her a quick pat on the head as she stood up. The voice on the phone was chuckling to themselves the whole time.

"You can't give me an open promise like that. I'll exact my toll in cuddles and smooches, or so help me." The voice tried to sound serious, but even through a phone call, the shape of a smile on their lips couldn't be mistaken.

"See you soon, Dee." Brun said as she ended the call and pocketed her phone.

"She said you'd pay her with kisses?" Felicity said, an unreadable expression on her face.

"She just says that, never lays a hand on me. I think she just likes to joke, and it seems like a safe enough thing to joke about. Better than when we first met, she had a far worse opinion of herself, but she's much more chipper now." Brun gestured for Felicity to follow her back out with her own apple as they walked back to the kitchen to return the plate.

***

Debug strode down the street, taking slightly longer strides than were comfortable. She often rushed when she knew she'd have an overlapping shift with Bee.

Daydreams of being held by the strong arms of the taller woman filled her mind. She didn't have the confidence to seriously tell Bee about her feelings and the urges watching them work fostered in her. Thoughts of Bee swirled in her mind she was reminded that she had had to come up with a fictional interest in hair styling and fashion to explain away her intense gaze of her coworker. When she had initially blurted her thoughts months ago when the pair had first met Brunhilde hadn't taken them seriously at all. It was a bit of a struggle, to continue to have the urges to reach out to someone only for them to not notice or think it a joke.

It felt like a serious treat to have woken from a heated dream about Bee, only for her to call and ask for a favor so soon after Debug woke up. Normally there was more than enough time between any fantasies or dreams to when she'd have to face the source of her fascination to let her cool down to just a chaotic glee. So it was hard to not volunteer to help and an excuse fell out of her mouth before she could stop herself.

Thinking back on the phone conversation they'd had minutes earlier she had heard another voice. She didn't get much of an impression of the woman Bee had introduced as "Trouble" earlier in the day. They'd had sanctuary cases before, but Brunhilde hadn't gotten this involved before. Debug was barely acknowledging her jealousy of the attention that Brunhilde was paying to this woman that if she were to swap spots with, she wouldn't know what to do with herself.

Turning into the expansive and rarely full car park of the hotel, Debug attempted to get into her work persona.

"I care about what guests think and they're allowed to ask stupid questions." She chanted to herself. "I'm amazing at my job and people need my help."

Her chants continued until the moment before she stepped past the horizon of vision of the front door's presence sensor. An expression of serious confidence settled into place.

The reception contained an amusing sight. Trouble stood awkwardly in the corner of the room while Bee was processing a guest checking out. Debug assumed they had been chatting until someone had come by that actually required Brunhilde to do her job. Debug thought that Trouble must not have a job that required looking busy.

Knowing the protocol, Debug strode past Brunhilde and into the office behind the front desk to pretend to clock in or whatever guests thought they did when out of view before returning to stand at the desk next to Brun.

"Ma'am, is there something I can help you with?" Debug teasingly called to Trouble. Who spun around looking confused. Debug saw the realization dawn on Trouble's face as she recognized the uniform, followed by her trudging over to the desk very uncertain with how she was being helped. "Actually, between you and me..." Debug murmured to prevent Brunhilde or her guest from hearing. "Anything you can tell me about who we're keeping you safe from? This is the period we expect dickheads to try and seek people out." Her words were accompanied by a knowing glance at Trouble's several visible bruises.

"I don't want to be a bother..." Trouble started, her voice not needing to be lowered at all to prevent other parties from overhearing.

"Extra info can help us keep you safe and keep us safe. We don't want to give away any guest's info, but its not always possible to tell the difference between someone forgetting their own room number and trying to phish someone else's out of us. Vague descriptions are fine. As long as its more than just 'Tall, white and angry.' That will include too many people to help." The look on Trouble's face certainly made it seem like Debug had taken the words out of her mouth.

Brunhilde came around the front of the desk as she'd finished doing her job before taking Trouble's hand. Debug first thought that she had better have grabbed Trouble's non-injured hand, before doing her best to not think about Bee leading her instead around by the hand like an overly keen puppy.

"Dee, again, thanks so much." Brun said with a smile that tried to buckle Debug's knees. "I'll make this up to you."

"That's unfair." Debug muttered to herself, quiet enough neither of the ladies leaving through the front door could hear.
