Debug was done with today. She just wanted to turn herself off like a computer and handle the rest of what was left of today after a relaxing coma.

She trudged into the bus stop shelter, the warm wind vanishing as she did, and set Trouble down before collapsing herself into a lump on the pavement. Trouble was certainly living up to her name, but if names were someone's main feature Debug would need to change hers to Complication.
