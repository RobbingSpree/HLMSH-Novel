Debug was done with today. She just wanted to turn herself off like a computer and handle the rest of what was left of today after a relaxing coma.

She trudged into the bus stop shelter, the warm wind vanishing as she did, and set Trouble down on the seat before she collapsed into a lump on the pavement. Trouble was certainly living up to her name, but if names were someone's main feature Debug would need to change hers to Complication.

Today had been a catastrophic series of emotional shifts, if one could get an injury from emotional whiplash Debug was sure she should have it by now.

She had got into the hotel early today, around when her shift would normally start, but instead had spent the whole day relaxing and reading books on fascinating natural phenomenon while Trouble did their day job. She couldn't remember anything she had read today, she had been too distracted day dreaming about the possibility of living a happy life in her own home with her very own wife. It was something she had learned since meeting Trouble, but simply existing in the same space as someone else and doing unrelated, low effort tasks was actually a wonderful way to spend the day.

By the time that the afternoon arrived and she started to help Trouble put no their makeup over the few remaining bruises they had left, she was so lost in the sauce of day dreaming she almost said aloud some of the things she was day dreaming about. She had moved onto a story where she was Trouble's maid, who was a delicate princess, and the two of them were having a secret illicit affair. She was a little surprised that something that sounded like one of the stories Manager Beth recounted to her on dull day shifts came to mind.

Her whole plan for the day had come from wanting to ween Trouble, and by extension herself, off their physical affection as a method for allaying Trouble's anxiety. The fact that Debug would worry about her friend any time she had a day off and couldn't check on them, that she had stopped by on days she had no work just to briefly visit, give Trouble a kiss and leave, she was starting to resent herself. Taking advantage of someone like this felt wrong, like she was manipulating them, or worse.

So instead, she just tried to make the whole room more relaxing and safe. And it had seemed to work, if not for her own desires. She was sure Trouble was straight, she didn't know how they justified to themselves what their kisses meant, but for herself she was trying to fill a void. A gaping hole in her heart that years of staying closed off from others and keeping an emotional distance had made stable. Before she met Trouble she could go weeks without talking to anyone as herself, just putting on a mask and pretending to be what they needed. 

But now that she had started to pour longing and desire back into that void, she felt unstable, like if her wants got much worse she would put herself in a position where she could get seriously hurt again. She knew from her childhood that she didn't have a very strong will, if she wanted something hard enough she would let a lot of bad things happen to get it. And while physical affection wasn't food, it felt like nourishment all the same. The feeling of powerlessness, of being at the whims of someone else's wants.

It curdled her blood.

So she had decided, to make sure Trouble didn't get into trouble immediately if she went cold turkey, she would work on something else to help with their anxieties. 

And that had lead to today. 

What should have been a relaxing day of work followed by a nice evening walk with a treat to eat as they went home, had turned into an utter shambles.

Debug had planned to spend the whole day not touching Trouble except for doing their makeup. But once they left the hotel she noticed too late they were already holding hands. Debug hated herself for how her heart sang at Trouble touch. After traveling all the way to the mall with Trouble hand in hand she understood why they never let go of Brunhilde's hand when they got the chance. Even in the present, Debug considered herself a pale imitation of Brun as she struggled both literally and emotionally to support Trouble.

Even when Sinéad had appeared, they'd been unable to keep her cool and needed Trouble to clumsily try and reassure her with her hand still locked in it's cast. Debug had to admit Sinéad had been the closest thing she had known to what other people described as a mother. It had been a struggle to not throw themselves into their arms and beg to be taken home, to simply let herself break. To fall apart and and let someone else take care of them. But having Trouble's hand in theirs, having them try to reassure her despite the challenges of their arm in a cast.

It wasn't her lot to be allowed to be soft and cared for.

When Sinéad had first appeared Debug simply pretended she was once again back in high school and in incredible amounts of trouble for flaunting some rule or getting into a fight. Using the style of poetic and metaphoric codewords she used back then to let Sinéad know what was going on before anyone else got a chance to. 

But then she had changed strategy. She had broken her own rule.

In the brief time they lived together, she had always let Debug decide the emotional scope of their conversations. If Debug put up a wall, they wouldn't try to sneak past it. But not today it seemed. 

Not if she wasn't a helpless child.

Not if they wanted something badly enough.

Debug couldn't see it as a kindness, as someone trying to reconnect. It just felt like manipulation. To talk in a voice she had trusted, to try and act like years hadn't passed them by. It was true, she had vanished as soon as she was legally allowed to, hadn't called, and aside from the note she left behind when she disappeared she hadn't written. 

She knew Sinéad had known she was safe, or at least alive. One of the first things Debug had done when she had run away, was identity theft. She had assumed some middle aged lady's identity, got a job as a clerk in the local government office that dealt with births, deaths, marriages and name changes. With access to that she had invented herself a new identity.  No longer was she a victim in a string of child endangerment and abuse cases, she had made herself a whole new identity. She couldn't be bullied by the police to testify against her enemies, enemies who could use her appearances in court to stalk and harass her anew. 

When she had made her new identity she had written her old name as her own mother, the one Sinéad had picked with her when they had first met and she first was put into "protective" custody. A paper trail that someone like Sinéad could use to find her.

But they hadn't. 

Instead, today they had acted like they were doing her a favor. Perhaps she might feel less harsh about the whole conversation in a week or two. Once they were far enough from the conversation that it wasn't a clear memory any more.

But while she was wrapped up in her own thoughts while she made her escape, something had happened to Trouble. When she had refocused on Trouble, they were very out of it and was trying to bend their wrist despite their cast. As soon as they stopped hyperventilating and relaxed: they fainted in Debug's arms. The fact she was already holding Trouble's head as they collapsed prevented them from getting a concussion, letting them gently lay on the ground wasn't hard. Lifting them back off the ground was another matter entirely. Brunhilde had always made carrying Trouble around look easy.

Thankfully, a very keen group of teens had been nearby and jumpped into action. They had jabbered several theories on why Trouble had fainted and none of them sounded serious. They settled on some blood pressure issue when Debug had mentioned it wasn't the first time this month that they'd been out cold. Then they had helped Debug get Trouble up on her back to give them a piggy back 'out to the car' or so she lied.

She'd actually just trudged several bus stops away, not feeling safe at the the ones near the mall and fearing Sinéad would somehow see them, or worse the officer who she'd been seemingly out on a date with. She needed to be relied on right now, and letting any of her emotions about Sinéad cloud her judgement wasn't going to help. Trouble seemed like they needed reliable friends and Debug was sure if she let anyone know how fragile she actually was she wouldn't be able to consider herself strong enough to be relied upon ever again.

Since trouble hadn't stirred the whole time she had been stewing, Debug pulled out their brick of a phone and called the nurse's hotline to work out if she needed to take Trouble back to the hospital.

Brun refused to lose every argument she had with herself. One would think she was also winning the arguments since it was with herself. But the side she wanted to win simply wasn't.

She had spent her whole previous shift fretting about how to talk to either Debug or Trouble about how she had been feeling, and every time she tried to imagine what they might say she could never find words to explain how she felt to herself, let alone to other people.

As she walked back into the hotel for her next shift, hoping that by being in the building she was expecting to have a fight in she could imagine a better outcome than her friends rebuffing her and decrying her lacking of positive emotion around sexual interests. 

She had spent all her waking hours thinking on the subject and was feeling less dread about the prospect of romance. She might have been conflating too many things with something she didn't like. She could imagine happy scenarios where someone did nice things for her and gave her a gift or a chaste kiss, or a warm embrace. Where she could be physically intimate in a kind way. But trying to imagine anything more serious was off-putting.

Maybe part of the problem was how inexperienced she was. 

"But it's just sex. What else is there? You have the primal urge then you do the deed." She muttered to herself and the nearby crow she had befriended that frequented their car park. "If you don't get the urge you don't do the deed. It's not like you can add rules like it's football or something fun." 

Setting her internal discussion aside, Brun walked through the front door to meet the eye of Gary. One of the few staff she now dreaded doing a handover with.

Minutes later, as she walked into the staff room behind the reception she found an odd situation: Manager Beth was still where she had last seen her, eight hours ago, sitting in front of the management computer. Except now she had notes and what looked like timelines strewn about the desk.

"You find that guy you were looking for?" Brun asked, now a little concerned this meant Trouble wasn't safe.

"What?" Beth scrambled to cover her notes. "Ahh, no. There was a guest taking something that didn't belong to them. So I was tracking their movements to see what they took." They got up from their seat and faced Brun. "What are you doing here?"

"Beth...it's 7pm. I'm here for the start of my shift." Brun gave her manager the most withering look she could manage. "What are you doing here?"

"If I stop now, the tape's get erased with the month roll over." Beth said looking like her exhaustion was rapidly catching up to her.

"Is it worth being a total wreck?" She didn't particularly care what Beth looked like, and they were surprisingly put together for someone who was approaching 26 hours awake. But she knew Beth would judge herself harshly if they thought they weren't presentable for others.

"I'll go lay down in the nap room for a hot minute. But this...this is important." They appeared to re-inflate with the reassurance to themselves they could continue planning their vendetta.

"What did the guest even steal? What's worth this much effort?" Brun was a little worried, the hotel didn't have anything of actual value and began thinking someone had started stripping the copper pipes and wires from the rooms.

"I had a snack I was saving. And they stole it." Beth's eyes flashed with a very serious energy. Brun wrote it off entirely and put the whole nonsense from her mind.

"You steal that...I'll do worse..." Beth muttered as they staggered away.

Brun began trying to imagine her friends not getting angry at her, first she needed to work out how Debug would think.

Debug felt wrung dry and sun bleached, which was odd for someone who'd not been directly in natural light all day and felt like they had a thin film of half dried sweat covering their body.

They could march for a long while still, but they were very glad they hadn't needed to carry Trouble any further than the bus stop. 

Debug had muscles, enough to get herself into mischief; apparently not enough to get herself back out of it. She was used to using engineering to multiply her strength rather than simply being as strong as needed. She strongly suspected her terrible eating habits were part of why she had stayed short and never put on muscle, but it could be inherited for all she knew since she didn't share a drop of blood with anyone who had called themself her parent.

Trouble firmly held her hand and walked by her side rather than trailing behind her as they had done when they had left the hotel several hours earlier. She wasn't sure what about fainting from seemingly nowhere had given them a confidence boost, but since waking back up at the bus stop they hadn't hidden behind Debug since. That or they knew it had been as bad as it was because Debug hadn't seen anything leading up to the problem, so if they stayed in her peripheral vision Debug would be able to help quicker.

Either way, as they approached the hotel front door, Debug stopped and bowed to her companion gently kissing their hand. The act being the furthest thing from chaste purity they'd done all day. As debug looked back up to see their reaction she caught a sly smile being smothered. Hopefully being playful would help smooth over their rough evening.

"Good evening then. It has been most wonderful, except for the minor hiccough towards the end." Trouble said through an incredibly thick fake British accent. Before taking the lead and entering the hotel.

Debug didn't like what they saw inside. 

Manager Beth had a wild look in their eyes and Brun stood behind the reception like they had just been told an incredibly personal insult.

"Debug!" They both said in unison.

"I have a question I need to ask you." Manager Beth steamrolled over whatever Brun was trying to say. "Since there's a few people here do you mind taking a walk with me while I say my piece?" Their face was unreadable, but they looked both exhausted and totally wired.

Brun visibly deflated for some reason, Debug hoped Trouble didn't assume it was their fault.

"I'll come back and we can chat later, okay?" She said as she nodded at Brun before following Beth as they walked out the back of the reception.
