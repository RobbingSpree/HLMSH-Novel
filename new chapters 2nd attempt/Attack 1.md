Debug was unsure what was going on as she followed Beth through the back rooms of the hotel. 

They normally didn't ask anything of her unless something technical broke, and it was normally just to find and explain what was broken so Beth wouldn't get price gouged by repairmen. But from where she was leading her, the only thing out this way was the fire escape and utility rooms.

As Beth lead Debug down yet another maintenance corridor she had never bothered to explore, they stopped a few steps ahead and looked like they took something out of their pocket. They turned back to look at Debug and the only thing that stood out was one of Beth's eyes was vigorously held shut, like she'd got dust in it.

Darkness fell.

The whole corridor went pitch black.

No sounds rang out except the sizzle of the lights overhead quickly cooling.

Debug was incredibly blind in the sudden darkness and grabbed for the handrail that ran the legth of the hallway. Through it she could feel an odd trill like metal on metal.

Before they had a chance to react or ask if Beth was okay, they felt metal close around their wrist.

Handcuffs.

Debug tried to pull her hand back and recoil, but the other end of the cuffs must have been further along the rail as she couldn't move far.

Panic seized her heart.

A second handcuff seized her other wrist and wrenched her arm up.

The sound of the other end being closed around something above her rang out in the darkness.

Both arms now spread wide at awkward angles and unable to protect her body. Sensing her worsening vulnerability, Debug tried to turn side on to where she expected violence from.

The heel of a boot struck her near the hip and pushed her off balance.

The cuffs held tight and stopped her from falling to the ground but her arms and shoulder flashed pain into her mind as they suddenly caught her full body weight. A cruel hand grabbed her jaw and forced her to look up into the darkness. 

"You're my trophy. My prize." Debug hated how right she had been for not wanting to trust Beth. "And that scuffed slut takes your lips before I did?"

Debug went limp and stopped trying to struggle, the panic died as familiar feeling of being physically trapped settled in. She knew what most people like this wanted, and giving up quickly would be her best bet in the short term. If she wanted a chance to be alone with the handcuffs to break free she would need Beth to think they were foolproof.

"Ohh, giving in so soon, Pet?" Debug flinched at that word. "I expected you to put on a brave face, you always talked such a big game." Rough hands groped at Debug.

As she hung there, senses getting accustomed to the dark, she heard a noise that made her stomach drop. The sound of a box cutter knife extending.

A hand grabbed at her shirt. She knew what was coming next.

Taking measured and controlled breaths and trying to stay calm while Beth cut the front of her shirt and bra leaving her chest exposed for no one to see.

Several flashes in the dark proved her wrong. As Beth took a photo of her crimes. Debug concluded they were either going to let her go and blackmail her or not let her go and maybe murder her. 

She felt incredibly numb.

The pain from her arms was easy enough to ignore. With a bit of effort in the current situation she could probably dissociate entirely and just not be present for what happened next. Let the whole problem wash over her like an angry, lustful wave.

She'd have new nightmares for sure. But if she let go of her own mind for a bit, she could focus more on escape later than protecting herself now.

She didn't expect any help to come, Beth could just leave and put up a sign saying no entry. And since Debug was the only person on staff trusted to ignore such signs, no one would think to check inside.

A noise brought Debug back to the present. A buzzing noise.

Beth had cut Debug's pants too, and was clearly threatening her with a small vibrator. Debug regretted coming back to herself. Something as annoying as that would be very hard to dissociate away from.

Suddenly the picture slid into focus. Today was the last day of the month, Beth would have been looking at the cameras and seen Trouble and her kiss at least once. If they had been as entitled and possessive as they were acting she could guess they had an imagined some slight and wanted to mark or stain her in some way. As if that sort of nonsense work or endeared someone to you.

Now all she needed to know was what Beth thought they wanted. If she could either pretend to give them that or actually give them what they wanted they might leave her alone.

She didn't know if this waking nightmare was worse than knowing Sin√©ad knew she was nearby or not.
