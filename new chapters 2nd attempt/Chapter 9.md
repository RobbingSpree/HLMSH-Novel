Brun was familiar with this sensation of exhaustion, just yesterday she'd dragged herself the extra mile and today she was doing it again.

She had sent Debug back to the car to fetch Trouble quite a while ago. And the longer she waited, the more likely she'd just go to sleep first. It wasn't that she didn't trust Debug, more that she knew how exhausted they were and was a bit worried they might not have made it all the way to the car without needing a sit down.

Leaving Trouble's room behind and walking the halls of the hotel again, she let her mind wonder. In the car ride back, Debug had been a lot more talkative than normal, and honest. While she couldn't tell when Debug lied, they seemed much too practiced at that, she could generally tell when they told the truth. What kind of life must they have lived where the truth was such a difficult topic to broach.

And as much as she claimed to understand Trouble, she had been purposefully ignoring their circumstances. Trying to leave them space to feel safe first, get comfortable and come to find here as a real home. But that also meant that she knew next to nothing about them. 

As she had walked around their house, she had seen all sorts of signs of the people who lived there. Trouble's stuff was all easy to find since it was crammed into the corners of only a few rooms. You could see how little space she was trying to take up, in comparison she might find the room here at the hotel too sparse and barren to be comfortable in.

Brun wondered if this sort of consideration was why Debug had kept her at arms length. Was she just that bad at accommodating the wants or needs of others? She hadn't been the one Trouble had actually asked for help about her work stuff. It had been the reliable one of the two of them.

Brun walked through the reception and peered out the front door. 

The car sat empty.

How could they have gotten lost?

It's a pretty straight shot from Trouble's room to the reception, and with how tired Debug was, Brun could see no way for them not be found.

Brun turned around and started to head back to where she came from. If she was also out and looking, they could find the room empty and set out in search for her. But as she got part way through the reception again she heard an odd noise.

It sounded like someone struggling to lift or push something, like they were doing serious work. 

But it came from behind the reception desk.

Brun hadn't seen anyone at the desk so she assumed the currently on shift people were doing stuff elsewhere, the time right before dawn was a great time to get chores and tasks done around the hotel.

She backtracked a few steps, leaning to see if she could spot who was back there and what they were doing. If it wasn't anything serious she could ask for help finding Debug and Trouble.

She recognized those shoes.

She'd told Dee they weren't work appropriate just last week.

What was Debug doing back there she wondered?

A sigh. A muffled noise. The ruffle of clothes.

There was someone else back there. Brun was not so naive to not know what those sounds meant.

She didn't know who was on shift this morning, nor that they had this sort of relationship with Dee.
