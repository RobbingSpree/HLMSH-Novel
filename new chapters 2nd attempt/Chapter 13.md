Brun looked a her own reflection in the reception monitor, it felt like she couldn't meet it's gaze.

The last few weeks had been a lot for her emotionally.

First, she felt like such a fool for forgetting that she might not be the normal one when it came to not enjoying thing of a sexual nature. She didn't think she had forced herself to date people before, but her ability to keep up with their appetite felt like it had been the underlying reason why her relationships had turned sour. It didn't explain why her partners had been so cruel as the relationships deteriorated, but it was a good enough reason to simply never pursue it herself.

The few years she had known Beth and Debug, neither had mentioned a romantic partner; and since they were who she had the majority of honest conversations with she had entirely forgotten that romance wasn't just something made up for soap operas.

But now that it's existence had crashed into her psyche again it was all she could think about. Was this conversation tinged with romance? Could this be construed as flirting? If she didn't play along with the rules of romance would she upset her friends?

When she had visited the numerous cafes near the hotel and seen other ladies meeting up for a get together, they were a lot more handsy than she ever felt comfortable being. They would mock kiss one another and playfully touch one another's bodies. Now when Trouble stood too close or Debug's voice had too much playfulness in it she worried she would do something wrong and ruin a moment.

She had also felt terrible about invading Debug's privacy seeking out the staff member Brun had caught making out with them.
