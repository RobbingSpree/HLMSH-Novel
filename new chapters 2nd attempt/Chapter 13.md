Brun looked a her own reflection in the reception monitor, it felt like she couldn't meet it's gaze.

The last few weeks had been a lot for her emotionally, and the quiet Wednesday morning shift was exactly the place to linger with her thoughts uninterrupted.

First, she felt like such a fool for forgetting that she might not be the normal one when it came to not enjoying thing of a sexual nature. She didn't think she had forced herself to date people before, but her inability to keep up with their appetite felt like it had been the underlying reason why her relationships had turned sour. It didn't explain why her partners had been so cruel as the relationships deteriorated, but it was a good enough reason to simply never again pursue it herself.

The few years she had known Beth and Debug, neither had mentioned a romantic partner; and since they were who she had the majority of honest conversations with she had entirely forgotten that romance wasn't just something made up for soap operas.

But now that it's existence had crashed into her psyche again it was all she could think about. Was this conversation tinged with romance? Could this be construed as flirting? If she didn't play along with the rules of romance would she upset her friends?

When she had visited the numerous cafes near the hotel and seen other ladies meeting up for a get together, they were a lot more handsy than she ever felt comfortable being. They would mock kiss one another and playfully touch one another's bodies. Now when Trouble stood too close or Debug's voice had too much playfulness in it she worried she would do something wrong and ruin a moment.

She had also felt terrible about invading Debug's privacy seeking out the staff member Brun had caught making out with them.

And this butted into her second problem: her jealousy over Trouble's attention. The way she had established how they spent their time together made her concerned other people should think there was something sexual about their relationship. But all the same, she still very much enjoyed being very physically close with Trouble. Walking about by leading her by the hand, holding them close when they seemed anxious or concerned, giving them a gentle peck on the head to signify they were going to leave. Trouble was like an adorable pet a lot of the time, so how could she not act like that?

She had to assume Trouble was straight due to her long term boyfriend, so she was sure they weren't looking at their physical intimacy as anything other than a comforting presence. And in the same breath she could only assume since she hadn't pressed Trouble for any details or their past. Maybe she should be asking Trouble more about themselves, or at least their emotions.

From their observation, Brun was starting to see similarities between how Dee and Trouble behaved. What she had assumed was just Dee being cold and aloof had a lot in common with how Trouble got agitated in open spaces or around specific noises like cupboards or latches being closed. But she had no idea what to do with these conclusions, did Debug appreciate the cavalier way Brun had treated them in the past? Did they like being treated normally, or were they also hoping to have some delicacy thrown their way? 

The other way Debug and Trouble had started overlapping in Brun's mind was the way Trouble had suddenly dyed their hair to match Debug. Brun had turned up last Saturday night only to find a malnourished doppelganger where she expected to find her fluffy blonde puppy. The bit she was struggling with the most was the sudden disappearance of Trouble's bruises under a layer or two of makeup. She'd never seen them not marked with countless purple and yellow blemishes, and while they had been fading, it was like a slowly shifting artwork. She didn't know how to feel and felt worse for wanting to see Trouble marked like she normally was.

But being able to go out with Trouble and spend time together outside of work was worth the sudden change, so she held her tongue and didn't mention any of her thoughts on the matter.

But how does one even tell their friend that? 

"I like it when you're bruised and I need to protect you?" Brun muttered to themself like their idea of a crazy person.

Rather than continue to be tormented by their thoughts, they were interrupted by the arrival of Beth.

"Morning Boss, we don't normally see you in this early." Brun said, trying to sound normal and not at all haunted.

"I need to review the video footage for all the cameras before they get moved to deep storage. And with the weird guy loitering outside a few weeks ago I'm going to have to go through it with a fine toothed comb to see if anyone suspicious was about." Beth heaved an enormous sigh. "This is going to take me all day, so I might as well get a start on it now." Beth walked past her and into the staff room making dramatic noises while the moved the one good chair to the management computer.

"Want me to fix you some breakfast? I'm not expecting any thing to happen at the front desk till the shift swap happens at six." Brun asked, trying to be helpful like she normally was.

"Sure, anything fried and a tall juice will help. And don't look at this computer unless you want to see how you look from behind at three different angles." Beth said as she leaned around the door frame. "The overhead camera makes everyone look bad." Pointing at what Beth had assumed was a light fighting that was never turned on above and behind where she stood at the reception.

Trouble felt like a flower that took dozens of years to bloom under constant care and vigilance finally showing signs of that effort bearing fruit. 

Debug had decided to spend their whole day together. The had quietly sat through all her client meetings reading through a pile of library books while she was playing the role of working adult encircled by a pillow fort Brun had built her the night prior. She couldn't dismiss the power of the pillow fort, in the deep of night when she had a giant empty bed, the extra weight and shadows to hid behind felt reliable and reassuring.

Having Bug quietly sitting nearby made her think it was like how having a big dog would be. Where they just take up an obvious amount of space and keep an eye on you throughout the day, but otherwise would do their own thing. She wouldn't have minded if Bug was more of a lap dog, but she knew she'd get no work done if they were. Something she had lamented, was the lack of a good reason to ask for any kisses.

The whole day was a build up to them heading out once the sun started to set. 

The daylight still gave Trouble anxiety, too many people around who could see her from a distance, too many cars driving around to keep track of, too much background noise of the city. But once the sun set and most people went home for the day, she felt safe. Even though she knew it was also the time of day she was most likely to run into Frank, he didn't have any grace or guile so she felt she could spot him coming and could act first.
