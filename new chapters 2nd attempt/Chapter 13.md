Brun looked a her own reflection in the reception monitor, it felt like she couldn't meet it's gaze.

The last few weeks had been a lot for her emotionally.

First, she felt like such a fool for forgetting that she might not be the normal one when it came to not enjoying thing of a sexual nature. She didn't think she had forced herself to date people before, but her inability to keep up with their appetite felt like it had been the underlying reason why her relationships had turned sour. It didn't explain why her partners had been so cruel as the relationships deteriorated, but it was a good enough reason to simply never again pursue it herself.

The few years she had known Beth and Debug, neither had mentioned a romantic partner; and since they were who she had the majority of honest conversations with she had entirely forgotten that romance wasn't just something made up for soap operas.

But now that it's existence had crashed into her psyche again it was all she could think about. Was this conversation tinged with romance? Could this be construed as flirting? If she didn't play along with the rules of romance would she upset her friends?

When she had visited the numerous cafes near the hotel and seen other ladies meeting up for a get together, they were a lot more handsy than she ever felt comfortable being. They would mock kiss one another and playfully touch one another's bodies. Now when Trouble stood too close or Debug's voice had too much playfulness in it she worried she would do something wrong and ruin a moment.

She had also felt terrible about invading Debug's privacy seeking out the staff member Brun had caught making out with them.

And this butted into her second problem: her jealousy over Trouble's attention. The way she had established how they spent their time together made her concerned other people should think there was something sexual about their relationship. But all the same, she still very much enjoyed being very physically close with Trouble. Walking about by leading her by the hand, holding them close when they seemed anxious or concerned, giving them a gentle peck on the head to signify they were going to leave. Trouble was like an adorable pet a lot of the time, so how could she not act like that?

She had to assume Trouble was straight due to her long term boyfriend, so she was sure they weren't looking at their physical intimacy as anything other than a comforting presence. And in the same breath she could only assume since she hadn't pressed Trouble for any details or their past. Maybe she should be asking Trouble more about themselves, or at least their emotions.

The way they had suddenly dyed their hair to match Debug's was something that had thrown her for a loop. She'd turned up Saturday night only to find a malnourished doppleganger where she expected to find her fluffy blonde puppy. The bit she was struggling with the most was the sudden disappearance of Trouble's bruises. She'd never seen them not marked with countless blemishes, and while they had been fading, it was like a slowly shifting artwork. She didn't know how to feel and felt worse for wanting to see Trouble marked like she normally was.

But being able to go out with Trouble and spend time together outside of work was worth it, so she held her tongue and didn't mention any of her thoughts on the matter.
