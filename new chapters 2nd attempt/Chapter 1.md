The front door stood imposing and closed at the far end of the room. Felicity wasn't even facing it, but that door was all she could think about. 

Frank had just come home through that door, and as usual he smelled of alcohol and self-righteous anger. He had blown through the room like a megaphone attached to a vacuum, but Felicity didn't trust him to stay loud and harmless for long. He was sure to find something that upset him and lash out, and the last few days he'd been getting more and more aggressive with how he let that frustration spill out.

Felicity also worried that she wouldn't get very far. Frank had been dead-bolting the door when he left for work, functionally locking her in her own home. All the windows had bars and didn't open, and she was too scared of what Frank might do if she tried breaking one to escape, and due to all that she hadn't stepped foot outside in over a week.

The time had come, and a whole day of trying to think about escape plans wasn't helping now the moment to act was upon her. The best she had come up with, was claiming to need to walk to the nearby grocer to grab a loaf of bread since the unexpected humidity had caused theirs to turn. When Frank had come in blustering, ranting about something Felicity knew he didn't care about, he hadn't dead-bolted the door. Felicity realized this might be her only chance for a long while.

"Actually, that reminds me..." Her timid voice doing it's best to carry to the other end of the house. "The bread turned moldy and I wanted to have some egg on toast for breakfast..." A pause built, Felicity straining her ears to glean anything from the noises of the house and ignore any sounds that came through their thin walls. "So I'm just going to pop to the shop and get some!" Not wanting to give either Frank enough time to think about it or herself more time to panic and catastrophize, Felicity got up from her desk and turned to leave.

The walk to the front door felt glacial. She couldn't draw attention to herself until she'd gotten outside, months of very little exercise and being trapped in and around the house had made her unfit. If Frank caught on too soon she would be easy to catch and punish, even if he was drunk.

She snatched her wallet, from the table near the door where the house keys used to live, and reached out for the door handle. Sweat dripping from her hand, not from the effort but from the air, thick with humidity that got worse the closer to the door she got. Ears still straining to listen for any hint of trouble.

The door opened.

The door closed.

Felicity started running.

The weather outside was oppressive, thunderhead clouds loomed ominously and the humidity made it feel you could cut the air with a knife. The low ceiling of clouds seemed to make all sounds muffled, and the lack of anyone else out at this time of day made the world seem empty. It was a bit early for spring storms, but they arrived regardless. The fading light of the sunset being smothered by the overhead ceiling of clouds caused the streetlights to turn on early.

She wanted to scream, with exuberance, with panic, with frustration, but that would be for when she was properly free, not just on the run. Her lungs heaved and her feet pounding bare on the pavement, she had entirely forgotten to put on any shoes, but as long as the storm didn't break she wouldn't have any trouble.

The storm broke minutes later and began dumping bucket after bucket of rain down on the city, and shortly after winds began to blow. Felicity was sure no one would be foolish enough to follow out in this weather, which should give her a solid head start, now she just needed to capitalize on it. The rain was warm and sun kissed and helped relieve her complaining muscles as she ran.

What she hadn't considered was where to hide. The shelters she knew wouldn't help, not because they would turn her away, but because with Frank's police connections it would be the first place he would check, and they would simply hand her over to protect everyone else staying there. She had sat through enough poorly told stories about what he and his police friends had done and the people they had abducted from the shelters to know that that was not a choice she could make.

As Felicity got to the business end of town, where the city bothered to put the nicer sidewalks and decorative footpath obstacles, trouble found her. She slipped on the smooth concrete, her bare feet failing to find purchase, and fell onto the rock solid ground. Her existing bruises and past injuries screaming with renewed alarm.

Moments passed as she lay on the footpath, the rain lashing her skin and turning cold. The tall buildings around funneled the strong winds into powerful forces, and as Felicity tried to push back onto her feet, her body acted like a sail, caught the wind, and she was scraped along the pavement until it suddenly changed directions and shunted her into the street for the tarmac to slow her back down.

While avoiding looking at her legs and hands; Felicity turned to try and face into the wind to not be pushed further from home for now. Knowing specifically what fresh injuries she'd gotten wouldn't help her now and the pain helped focus her mind. The winds died down for a moment and she scrambled back onto her feet, screaming all the while. Any noise she made in this moment was instantly drowned out by the howl of the storm. Rather than return to the pedestrian footpath, Felicity chose to stay on the road where she still had some grip. 

She didn't know how long she'd been out in the storm, but the wind and rain were starting drain the remaining warmth out of her. Any warmth she had built from running about was now just another thing for the wind to take from her. Before she'd escaped, the air conditioner in her house had been overwhelmed by the humidity and been doing a terrible job of cooling the house, so she'd been dressed in a light sleeveless shirt and thin pants. The only upside was: that these clothes weighed almost no different when soaked through and weren't slowing her down.

As the sun finished it's early setting, the clouds loomed in closer and the world became darker still, Felicity began to doubt herself. Maybe dying from exposure to the elements wasn't worse than what punishment waited for her at home. But rather than turn back and give into that fate, she continued to trudge onward. Her slower pace now a counterbalance to the winds that threatened to cast her back down on the road.

When Felicity's teeth started chattering from the cold, she knew she had to find somewhere so she could get out of the rain. A quick glance around, while fighting to see through rain streaming down her face, told her she was near the exhibition center. And near it was the hotel that always had their vacancy sign on.

An odd shaped building, like someone had asked a child to pick the layout of the rooms rather than use what would be space efficient. The building was tall but narrow and winding, and had lots of small courtyards, that even from the street with limited visibility, Felicity could see were doing their best to grow a pet tornado as the wind whipped around in the confined areas. The front door was well lit and didn't look like it had concrete for her to fall on.

She began to fight towards it.

***

Brunhilde dared the door to open, tools at the ready.

This evening's storm had been a complete surprise to Brun. What little sky she could see through open windows and the front door of the hotel had made it seem like it was simply overcast afternoon. The powerful building-wide air conditioning further hid the nature of how bad outside was.

An hour ago, when her coworker had left after their shift, they'd come straight back inside cursing the world and announcing their intent to steal some of the bottled water they kept in the supply closet. Brun had simply thought they'd been theatrical and exaggerated for fun, but this storm told another story.

In the present the wind howled, and rain lashed the ground right up to the decorative tiles at the front door of the hotel. It came in sheets, wave after wave of rain, only visible in the darkness when it struck the ground and caught the street lights, sweeping across the car park. Sometimes the wind would abruptly shift and the waves would break and scatter in various directions. It was mesmerizing to watch.

So far, two groups of rain soaked guests and a tumbling bucket had deigned to come in, bringing an entourage of puddles and extra work for Brun. As such, she now stood vigil waiting for the next person or debris unfortunate enough to come in and force her to do her job.

Brun enjoyed the evening shifts, normally quiet and people free. She could roam the many halls and get all her tasks done without having people to complicate matters. The few times she would see guests, it would be in the reception or the dining room when she came by to help tidy up with the wait staff. The real benefit of the night shift was that all the critters that lived in and around the building would venture out where Brun could see them.

She had a real weakness for injured or maligned animals. Their delicate tiny bodies that she could fit into her lap and experience their fluffiness. She'd considered asking her coworker if she could fluff their hair since they'd got an undercut and it looked especially soft, but with her own long braids that everyone knew weren't to be touched freely, she felt a bit socially trapped and simply didn't mention it.

Movement outside caught Brun's attention. At the edge of the car park she could see something moving. She would cry if it was some sad, wet animal that had been caught out in the storm.

Instead, as the figure grew closer and the lights in the car park finally showed their full height, Brun had to admit it was a human.  She was unsure what to do about them, they had no bags and appeared to not be wearing much clothes, making it unclear if they were a guest.

Brun walked back behind the reception desk to check for any expected arrivals left for tonight and found nothing. She watched them trudge closer and closer, swaying dangerously as the wind buffeted them. As they got closer still, she was able to make out tattoos on their arms and face. Were they just a person who lived nearby and had gotten locked out? The neighborhood near the hotel was mostly upper class houses, and when she had a day shift she had noted that the cafes nearby were filled with artistic looking people.

As the person got close enough for lights from the entrance to show them in detail Brun felt her blood ran cold. What she had mistaken for tattoos were an extensive series of bruises. She could see their teeth chattering in the cold, with one arm wrapped around their body for warmth and the other pushing against the wind to stay upright. She crouched to grab a towel from behind the desk. As she stood up to see the person get within spitting distance of the door, the wind turned violently once more they were pushed over and with a sickening, wet slap they were knocked to the ground.

The automatic door somehow didn't see them and stayed shut. Previous conversations about the automatic door seeing in infrared climbed out of her memories.

"Of course, it can't see them, they're too cold!" Brun rushed forward only to almost run into the closed door as it also did not open for her. "Ahh no, it's cause it's so bloody late!!" She punched the door release button everyone forgot existed, the door opened slowly and the wind fought to open it faster.

Brun knelt down to get a closer look. The person lay on the tiled ground, moving only as the wind tried to push them back out into the parking lot. The puddle they'd landed in didn't reach their mouth, so they didn't need to immediately be saved from drowning. The rain continued to lash their skin as they lay at the edge of where it reached. Brun swiftly rolled them over and hefted them into her arms princess style before carrying them back inside to actually get them out of the rain.

They felt like ice in her arms. The puddle they were wearing instantly soaking through Brun's shirt, pale skin casting their bruises into stark relief. The second thing Brun noticed was how little they weighed and wondered how easily they would be to carry once dry. As their sopping wet clothes drained onto the reception floor and into Brun's own, her eyes were drawn to their chest and their ribs an obvious undulating pattern through the shirt that might as well be transparent it was so thin and so heavily plastered to their skin by the rain. Watching the rise and fall of their breathing reassured her they still needed help.

Now that she had this mess of a person in her arms, Brun had to put them somewhere. Banishing thoughts of putting them into a nest of pillows like some kind of human sized dog bed, she came to the idea of putting them in the staff nap room. Though called a nap room it was little more than a broom cupboard crammed to fit a cot, chair and mirror and a desk phone they used to wake one another if need be.

As Brun carried their armful of person, trying her best to walk in such a way that their head didn't loll about too much, and studied their face. They had short, pale silver-blonde hair stuck slick to their head and a bruise on one side of their jaw near their ear and a fresh looking graze a little lower down on the same side. She noted the blue of their lips and their mostly healed black eye and some scars on their neck.

"You're in some trouble, aren't you?" She asked her unconscious passenger. Though before they could answer, Brun arrived at the nap room.

She hip checked the door to bop the handle down and door open in one practiced move, before cautiously sidling into the cramped room and regretting her choice of destination.

"...You take... you take clothes off a wet and cold person, right?" Brun asked herself, unsure if there would be much difference in what she could see of this person whether clothed or not with how poor a job their wet clothes were doing.

She placed them on the floor in a siting pose and peeled their shirt off. She furrowed her brow upon seeing their bare, mostly flat chest.

"Are you a woman, troubled one?" She asked, expecting no answer and sure she'd get an answer in a moment when she removed their pants.

The drawstring had been doing the majority of the work keeping their pants up, because as soon as the knot was undone and they were lifted back into Brun's arms their pants stayed exactly where they sat moments earlier sliding cleanly off. Brun nodded at their plain looking women's underwear.

"OK then, Trouble, let's get you in bed and then I'll get all the crinkly fire blankets to help keep you warm." She said as she placed the unconscious woman in the cot. "And I'll get you a warm wheat bag thing Manager Beth keeps around for period pain."

Brun busied herself over the next few hours. Keeping an eye on her ward, making sure her temperature started to come back up to safe levels, washing and drying their clothes, swapping the fire blankets for normal cotton ones once she was sure they were out of danger for their temperature. And all the while, their guest slept.
