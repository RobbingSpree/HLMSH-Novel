The door stood imposing and closed at the far end of the room. Felicity wasn't even facing it, but the door was all she could think about. 

Frank had just come home, and as usual he smelled of alcohol and self-righteous anger. He had blown through the room like a megaphone attached to a vacuum, but Felicity didn't trust him to stay loud and harmless for long. He was sure to find something that upset him, and the last few days he'd been getting more and more aggressive with how he got that frustration out.

Felicity also didn't think she'd even get very far. Frank had been deadbolting the door when he left for work, functionally locking her in her own home. All the windows had bars and didn't open, and she was too scared of what Frank would do if she tried breaking one to escape. She hadn't stepped foot outside in weeks.

The time had come, and a whole day of trying to think about how to escape wasn't helping now the time was upon her. The best she had come up with, was claiming to need to walk to the nearby grocer to grab a bread since the unexpected humidity had caused it to turn. When Frank had come in swearing he hadn't deadbolted the door, so this might be her last chance for a long while.

"Actually, that reminds me..." Her timid voice doing it's best to carry to the other end of the house. "The bread turned and I wanted to have some egg on toast for breakfast..." A pause built, Felicity straining her ears to glean anything from the noises and ignore any sounds
