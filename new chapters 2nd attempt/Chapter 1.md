The door stood imposing and closed at the far end of the room. Felicity wasn't even facing it, but the door was all she could think about. 

Frank had just come home, and as usual he smelled of alcohol and self-righteous anger. He had blown through the room like a megaphone attached to a vacuum, but Felicity didn't trust him to stay loud and harmless for long. He was sure to find something that upset him, and the last few days he'd been getting more and more aggressive with how he got that frustration out.

Felicity also didn't think she'd even get very far. Frank had been deadbolting the door when he left for work, functionally locking her in her own home. All the windows had bars and didn't open, and she was too scared of what Frank would do if she tried breaking one to escape. She hadn't stepped foot outside in over a week.

The time had come, and a whole day of trying to think about how to escape wasn't helping now the time was upon her. The best she had come up with, was claiming to need to walk to the nearby grocer to grab a bread since the unexpected humidity had caused it to turn. When Frank had come in swearing he hadn't deadbolted the door, so this might be her last chance for a long while.

"Actually, that reminds me..." Her timid voice doing it's best to carry to the other end of the house. "The bread turned and I wanted to have some egg on toast for breakfast..." A pause built, Felicity straining her ears to glean anything from the noises and ignore any sounds that came through their thin walls. "So I'm just going to pop to the shop and get some!" Not wanting to give either Frank enough time to think about it or herself more time to panic and catastrophize, Felicity got up from her desk and turned to face the door.

The walk to the front door felt glacial. She couldn't draw attention to herself until she'd gotten outside, months of very little excersize and being trapped in and around the house had made her unfit. If Frank caught on too soon she would be easy to catch and punish, even if he was drunk.

She snatched her wallet from the table near the door where the house keys used to live and reached out for the door handle. Sweat dripping from her hand, not from the effort but from the incredible humidity that got worse the closer to the door she got. Ears still straining to listen for any hint of trouble.

The door opened.

The door closed.

Felicity started running.

The weather outside was oppressive, thunderhead clouds loomed overhead ominously and the humidity made it feel like you could cut the air like butter. It was a bit early for spring storms, but they seemed to have arrived regardless. The fading light of the sunset being smothered by the overhead ceiling of clouds tripped the streetlights to turn on early.

She wanted to scream, but that would be for when she was properly free, not just on the run.

The storm broke minutes later and began dumping bucket after bucket of rain down on the city, and shortly after winds began to howl. Felicity was sure no one would be foolish to follow out in this weather, so her head start would lengthen, now she just needed to capitalize on it. The rain was warm and sun kissed and helped relieve her complaining muscles as she ran.

What she hadn't considered was where to hide. The shelters she knew wouldn't help, not because they would turn her away, but because with Frank's police connections it would be the first place he would check and they would simply hand her over. She had sat though enough poorly told stories about what he and his police friends had done to the people who they had abducted from the shelters to know that was not a choice she could make.

As Felicity got to the business end of town, where the city bothered to put the nicer sidewalks, her impulsive escape and lack of planning came back to bite her. She slipped on the smooth concrete, her bare feet failing to find purchase, and fell onto the rock solid ground. Her existing bruises and past injuries screaming with renewed alarm.

The tall buildings around funneled the strong winds into powerful forces, and as Felicity tried to push back onto her feet, her body acted like a sail and caught the wind and she was scraped along the pavement until it shunted her into the street for the tarmac to slow her back down.

She avoided looking at her legs and hands. Knowing what fresh injuries she'd gotten wouldn't help for now. The winds died down for a moment and she pushed herself back onto her feet, screaming all the while. Any noise she made was instantly drowned out by the howl of the storm. 

Rather than return to the pedestrian footpath, Felicity chose to stay on the road where she had some grip. If her feet weren't screaming in pain, she would have kicked herself for rushing with her escape and not grabbing shoes.

She didn't know how long she'd been out in the rain, but the wind and rain were starting to get cold. Any warmth they'd gathered from the sun was gone and now it was just a way for the wind to make her even colder. Before she'd escaped, the air conditioner in her house had been overwhelmed by the humidity and been doing a terrible job of cooling the house, so she'd been dressed in a light sleeveless shirt and thin pants. The only upside was these clothes weighed almost no different when soaked through.

As the sun finished it's early setting, the clouds loomed in closer and the world became darker, Felicity started to regret her choices. Maybe dying from exposure to the elements wasn't worse than what punishment waited for her at home. But rather than turn back and give into that fate, she continued to trudge onward. Her slower pace now a counterbalance to the winds that threatened to cast her back down on the road.

When Felicity's teeth started chattering from the cold, she had to pick a destination so she could get out of the rain. A quick glance around, while fighting to see through rain pounding on her face, told her she was near the exhibition center. And near it was the hotel that always had the vacancy sign on.

A odd shaped building, like someone had asked a child to pick the layout of the rooms rather than what would be space efficient. The building was tall but narrow and had lots of small courtyards that even from the street Felicity could see were doing their best to grow a tornado. The front door was well lit and didn't look like it had concrete for her to fall on.

She began to trudge towards it.
