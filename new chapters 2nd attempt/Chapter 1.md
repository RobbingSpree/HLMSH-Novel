The door stood imposing and closed at the far end of the room. Felicity wasn't even facing it, but the door was all she could think about. 

Frank had just come home, and as usual he smelled of alcohol and self-righteous anger. He had blown through the room like a megaphone attached to a vacuum, but Felicity didn't trust him to stay loud and harmless for long. He was sure to find something that upset him, and the last few days he'd been getting more and more aggressive with how he got that frustration out.

Felicity also didn't think she'd even get very far. Frank had been deadbolting the door when he left for work, functionally locking her in her own home. All the windows had bars and didn't open, and she was too scared of what Frank would do if she tried breaking one to escape. She hadn't stepped foot outside in over a week.

The time had come, and a whole day of trying to think about how to escape wasn't helping now the time was upon her. The best she had come up with, was claiming to need to walk to the nearby grocer to grab a bread since the unexpected humidity had caused it to turn. When Frank had come in swearing he hadn't deadbolted the door, so this might be her last chance for a long while.

"Actually, that reminds me..." Her timid voice doing it's best to carry to the other end of the house. "The bread turned and I wanted to have some egg on toast for breakfast..." A pause built, Felicity straining her ears to glean anything from the noises and ignore any sounds that came through their thin walls. "So I'm just going to pop to the shop and get some!" Not wanting to give either Frank enough time to think about it or herself more time to panic and catastrophize, Felicity got up from her desk and turned to face the door.

The walk to the front door felt glacial. She couldn't draw attention to herself until she'd gotten outside, months of very little excersize and being trapped in and around the house had made her unfit. If Frank caught on too soon she would be easy to catch and punish, even if he was drunk.

She snatched her wallet from the table near the door where the house keys used to live and reached out for the door handle. Sweat dripping from her hand, not from the effort but from the incredible humidity that got worse the closer to the door she got. Ears still straining to listen for any hint of trouble.

The door opened.

The door closed.

Felicity started running.

The weather outside was oppressive, thunderhead clouds loomed overhead ominously. It was a bit early for spring storms, but they seemed to have arrived regardless. The fading light of the sunset being smothered by the overhead ceiling of clouds.

She wanted to scream, but that would be for when she was properly free, not just on the run.

When the storm broke and began dumping bucket after bucket of rain down on the city, and then winds began to howl. Felicity was sure no one would be foolish to come out in this weather, so her headstart would lengthen, now she just needed to capitalize on it.

What she hadn't considered was where to hide. The shelters she knew wouldn't help, not because they would turn her away, but because with Frank's police connections it would be the first place he would check and they would simply hand her over. She had sat though several poorly told stories about what he and his police friends had done to some of the people who they had abduslcted from the shelters.

As Felicity got to the business end of town, where the city bothered to put the nicer sidewalks, her impulsive escape and lack of planning came back to bite her. She slipped on the smooth concrete, her bare feet failing to find purchase, and fell onto the rock solid ground. Her existing bruises and past injuries screaming with renewed alarm.

The tall buildings around funneled the strong winds into powerful forces, and as Felicity tried to push back onto her feet, her body acted like a sail and she was slid along the pavement until it shunted her into the street for the tarmack to slow her back down.

She avoided looking at her legs and hands. Knowing what fresh injuries she'd gotten wouldn't help for now. The winds died down for a moment and she pushed herself back onto her feet, screaming all the while. Any noise she made was instantly drowned out by the howl of the storm. 

Rather than return to the pedestrian footpath, Felicity chose to stay on the road where she
