Felicity does her best

***
Felicity stood and stared at her reflection.

Her bruises were far fewer; but she still had a sickly yellow undertone splotching everywhere. She could see details of her complexion she didn't know she had, crows feet around her eyes, and a hint of the freckles she envied Debug for. She still had terrible bags under her eyes, her sleep was often disturbed by violent nightmares that it felt like tearing herself out of glue when she woke up from them.

Scattered around her was all the makeup Bug had left her when they dyed her hair a few days ago. 

She had felt like a human person for the first time in a long time that day. 

Like she wasn't a broken vase put back together with spit and a poor eye for craftsmanship. If she put in the effort she could do the transformation herself.

She didn't know if she could survive asking Bug to do the whole process again. While entirely pleasant and meditative and one of her clearest memories of gentle touch, she didn't want to put her mental health to the test just to pretend to have someone love her. And even though she now had shirts with long sleeves and didn't need to cover quite as much of her skin, it would still be a big effort to undertake with her lack of skill.

In the mirror she wanted to see Trouble, the beautiful woman her friends seemed to see in her stead. She wanted to be the creature they treated her like, something worth protecting, sheltering and caring for.

She picked up the foundation and tried to steady her breathing.

"Here comes Trouble."

Brunhilde holds it in

***

Brun's skin crawled and she felt like she was going to throw up.

She forced herself into a very wide smile, a thing Dee had said helped with not throwing up, and stepped back out of reach of the guest, their hand slipping off her rear.

"Please have a pleasant stay, now...I have other duties to attend to."

As she walked away, her teeth set rigidly in a grimace now. She wanted to burn the clothes she was wearing and set herself on fire for good measure.

She couldn't understand why people though acting like that was okay. What part of her job invited creeps and perverts to touch her? Or was it something inherent to her?

She never heard Dee complain about that sort of thing.

Were they encouraging this? Were they the reason it was happening somehow? Was there a website somewhere advertising their hotel as somewhere you could get away with this?

Brun tried to calm herself, to let go of her fury and smother her revulsion.

Was this just something only she disliked? Was she the weird one for getting upset over this? She couldn't talk to Dee about this, she was afraid how she'd act or what she'd say. She couldn't talk to Trouble about it, she knew they'd had bad intimate experiences in the past, that much was as clear as the marks on their skin.

She knew she had to say something to someone, to get these feelings out before they ate her alive.

She just felt trapped and alone.

Trouble wants release

***

Trouble felt like she could breath.

Actually relax and breath, the anxiety that she didn't realize had been her constant companion was almost non-existent today.

She didn't want to dwell in self reflection at all, but in the same breath it was something she realized she desperately wanted. 

Her anxiety and fear had always felt like some powerful creature, prowling and lying in wait, keen to punish her for reaching too far beyond it's awareness. But with how Brun and Bug treated her, how safe they made her feel, it was like she was slowly poisoning her anxiety. Each kiss she savored was like a stake driven toward it's heart, each embrace from her tall friend was a single clawing finger cut shorter, and while that wasn't fatal for such a all consuming thing as anxiety...it was making a mark.

She knew that with time she would feel suffocated and withdrawn again.

But this moment of release, she felt it could give her the strength to stand up on her own power.

In the vacuum that her anxiety left, that peace started to fill up with other emotions.

What had been a fragile peace was starting to ring louder and louder.

The further reaches of her room felt more and more dangerous.

The creature in her heart stirred.

She wanted to be free of it. She deserved to live free of this.

Retreating back into the safest corner of her room, collapsing between the bed and the curtains, drawing her focus in, she tried to think of things that gave her strength.

For a moment, she thought of herself.
