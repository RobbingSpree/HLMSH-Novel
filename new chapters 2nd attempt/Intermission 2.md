Felicity does her best
***
Felicity stood and stared at her reflection.

Her bruises were far fewer but she still had a sickly yellow undertone splotching everywhere, she could see details of her complexion she didn't know she had. Crows feet around her eyes, and a hint of the freckles she envied Debug for. She still had terrible bags under her eyes, sleeping wasn't something she did easily.

Scattered around her was all the makeup Bug had left her when they dyed her hair a few days ago. 

She had felt like a person for the first time in a long time that day. 

Like she wasn't a broken vase put back together with glue and a poor eye for craftsmanship. If she put in the effort she could do the transformation herself.

She didn't know if she could survive asking Bug to do the whole process again. And since she now had shirts with long sleeves she didn't need to cover quite as much of her skin, it would still be a big effort to undertake.

In the mirror she wanted to see Trouble, the beautiful woman her friends seemed to see in her stead. She wanted to be the creature they treated her like, something worth protecting and sheltering.

She picked up the foundation and tried to steady her breathing.

"Here comes Trouble."

Brunhilde holds it in

Brun's skin crawled and she felt like she was going to throw up.

She forced herself to smile, a thing Dee had said helped with not throwing up, and stepped back out of reach of the guest, their hand slipping off her rear.

"Please have a pleasant stay, now...I have other duties to attend to."

As she walked away, her teeth set rigidly in a grimace now. She wanted to burn the clothes she was wearing and set herself on fire for good measure.

She couldn't understand why people though acting like that was okay. What part of her job invited creeps and perverts to touch her? Or was it something inherent to her?

She never heard Dee complain about that sort of thing.

Were they encouraging this? Were they the reason it was happening somehow? Was there a website somewhere advertising their hotel as somewhere you could get away with this?

Brun tried to calm herself, to let go of her fury and smother her revulsion.

Was this just something only she disliked? Was she the weird one for getting upset over this? She couldn't talk to Dee about this, she was afraid how she'd act. She couldn't talk to Trouble about it, she knew they'd had bad intimate experiences in the past, that much was as clear as the marks on their skin.

She just felt trapped and alone.
