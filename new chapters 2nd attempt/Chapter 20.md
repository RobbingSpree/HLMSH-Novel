Brun couldn't be at a loss for words, everyone else seemed to have taken that role already. 

If she didn't know better, Brun would think Trouble's mental health improved by having a couple of nurses fuss over her and document all her injuries. When she had last been brought to the hospital it had seemed like a turning point for them, they smiled more and had been more open after then. For this visit Brun had been spending more time with Dee since Sinéad had been making excuses and Brun was firm in her opinion that both women needed company even if they were in and out of consciousness.

When she had seen Trouble awake for the first time they had been quite out of it but seemed enthusiastic for affection despite their harrowing encounter that had put them back in hospital. But about a day later, she came back to find the nurses fussing over Trouble and physically removing Sinéad from the room which smelt like someone had thrown up. But from that point on, Trouble was almost entirely mute.

The best Brun could get out of her was humming and agreement noises, beyond that it was sad puppy dog eyes, or nodding. Trouble just seemed scared stiff at all times and like if she said anything she would burst into tears or be attacked by wild dogs. So Brun had been spending her days when not at work either snuggled up next to Trouble in their hospital bed or pushing them around in a wheelchair. The doctors said she was just needed to be kept under observation for a few days and to make sure she learned what not to do to burst her stitches. As much as she wanted to shower Trouble in kisses confident that would help her heal the nurses had been stern that the human mouth was full of germs and she had to wait until they were discharged at least. Brun had felt that blush for a solid hour after the nurses had read her so thoroughly.

On the other hand it was infuriating to be in the dark as to what had happened to turn her cuddle-hungry friend into a lawn ornament. One day it had been like keeping an eye on a drunk friend, the next it was like reassuring a puppy that was convinced that the fireworks that had upended it's world would be back any minute. 

Speaking of in the dark, Debug had somehow been even less forthcoming with answers despite being able to talk; though their mood was a lot angrier and self maligning than normal so Brun knew they were dealing with it somewhat. Typical of Brun, she found herself unable to directly press Dee for details and focused more of her time on reassuring them they were safe in her presence. Brun tried to sit along the lines of sight Dee would keep glancing when they were awake, trying to let them know she would literally act as a wall for her if need be. 

But she couldn't be without words or a plan. 

Today was when Trouble was being discharged, and they had been having nightmares about finding Debug injured at the hotel rather than the construction site. And Brun couldn't exactly reassure her the hotel was safe, she still had no answer as to how Dee got hurt or what had happened, and Beth wasn't answering her calls so she couldn't ask them either. She didn't know where she was taking Trouble once the nurses finished the discharge paperwork. 

Since they had said it would still be an hour or so, Brun wheeled Trouble upstairs to Debug's room in the short stay ward. 

Trouble reached back and put her hand on Brun's to get her attention and bring her back into the present, before pointing at the sign they were approaching. 

"Short stay ward." Brun read aloud, not sure what Trouble was trying to say until she watched as they underlined the word short as they passed the sign. "Yeah, I hope Dee's only here for a short while too. She got really banged up, but nothing serious." Brun had been practicing that lie so no one could hear any worry creep into her voice.

Home. Brun thought to herself. Where was home for Trouble now? She knew one person she could ask, and as they rounded the corner she saw her. Flanked by a nurse checking the two IV lines attached to her, Debug saw the pair approach and Brun tried to count the number of different emotions she could see pass over their face. Hope was what Debug's face settled on, hope that they brought good news.
