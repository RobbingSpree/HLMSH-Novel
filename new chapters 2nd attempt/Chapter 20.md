Brun couldn't be at a loss for words, everyone else seemed to have taken that role already. 

If she didn't know better, Brun would think Trouble's mental health was improved by having a couple of nurses fuss over her and document all her injuries. When she had last been brought to the hospital it had seemed like a turning point for them, they smiled more and had been more open after then. For this visit Brun had been spending more time with Dee since she had a lot more doctor checkups and Sinéad had bailed on any responsibilities she had claimed were important to her.

When she had seen Trouble awake for the first time they had been quite out of it but seemed enthusiastic for affection despite their harrowing encounter that had put them back in hospital. But about a day later, she came back to find the nurses fussing over Trouble and physically removing Sinéad from the room which smelt like someone had thrown up. But from that point on, Trouble was almost entirely mute.

The best Brun could get out of her was humming and agreement noises, beyond that it was sad puppy dog eyes, or nodding. Trouble just seemed scared stiff at all times and like if she said anything she would burst into tears or be attacked by wild dogs. So Brun had been spending her days when not at work either snuggled up next to Trouble in their hospital bed or pushing them around in a wheelchair. She had tried drawing any sort of voice out of Trouble only once since they had become mute, and it had resulted in hours of crying on both their parts. The nurses wouldn't say what had happened but Brun wasn't surprised if the weight of Trouble's past had started to get to her.

The doctors said she was just needed to be kept under observation for a few days and to make sure she learned what not to do to burst her stitches. And as much as she wanted to shower Trouble in kisses confident that would help her heal the wounds on her heart; the nurses had been stern that the human mouth was full of germs and she had to wait until they were discharged at least for that. Brun had felt that blush for a solid hour after the nurses had read her so thoroughly.

~~On the other hand it was infuriating to be in the dark as to what had happened to turn her cuddle-hungry friend into a lawn ornament. One day it had been like keeping an eye on a drunk friend, the next it was like reassuring a puppy that was convinced that the fireworks that had upended it's world would be back any minute.~~ 

Speaking of in the dark, Debug had somehow been even less forthcoming with answers despite being able to talk; though their mood was a lot angrier and self maligning than normal so Brun knew they were dealing with it somewhat. Typical of Brun, she found herself unable to directly press Dee for details and focused more of her time on reassuring them they were safe in her presence. Brun tried to sit along the lines of sight Dee would keep glancing when they were awake, trying to let them know she would literally act as a wall for her if need be. 

But she couldn't be without words or a plan. 

Today was when Trouble was being discharged, and they had been having nightmares about finding Debug injured at the hotel rather than the construction site. And Brun couldn't exactly reassure her the hotel was safe, she still had no answer as to how Dee got hurt or what had happened, and Beth wasn't answering her calls so she couldn't ask them either. She didn't know where she was taking Trouble once the nurses finished the discharge paperwork. But since they had said it would still be an hour or so, Brun wheeled Trouble upstairs to Debug's room in the short stay ward. 

Trouble reached back and put her hand on Brun's to get her attention and bring her back into the present, before pointing at the sign they were approaching. 

"Short stay ward." Brun read aloud, not sure what Trouble was trying to say until watching her underline the word short as they passed the sign. "Yeah, I hope Dee's only here for a short while before we take her home. She got really banged up, but it's nothing serious." Brun had been practicing that lie all week so no one could hear any worry creep into her voice.

Home. Brun thought to herself. Where was home for Trouble now? She knew one person she could ask, and as they rounded the corner she saw them. Flanked by a nurse checking the two IV lines attached to her and another taking her blood pressure, Debug looked up as she approached and Brun tried to count the number of different emotions she could see their face go through. Hope was what Debug's face settled on, hope that they brought good news.

"Trouble's been cleared for discharge today, the nurses say she'll be good to go home in about an hour. But I wanted to talk to you about that." Brun tried to keep a straight face, her heart felt like it was being twisted apart at the thought of leaving Dee here alone. Brun had already felt terrible about not being able to spend every waking moment caring for both of these dorks, but to have to leave one of them behind was worse.

"You're not going back to the hotel." Dee responded as the emotion drained off her face. It wasn't a question, they had either heard from the impressive whisper network among the nurses that Trouble was having nightmares, or they were making a demand with respect to what had happened to them. Dee had been uncharacteristically serious when it came to talking about what had happened to her, she wasn't even doing her old favorite of trying to make a game out of using a marker to connect all her injuries like a morbid game of connect the dots. 

"No, that place isn't home anymore." Brun could feel herself getting emotional and did her best to fight the rising urge to cry. "When you disappeared from it, when you weren't safe, when it hurt you. If you can't be safe there, we can't be there with you, and somewhere without you isn't home." Tears stung her eyes and she struggled to pretend she wasn't choking up. Dee seemed unmoved by her words, and with a pang of sadness for the disconnect between them Brun continued. "So the current plan is to take her to my place, but Frank might know where I live and he's already shown he knows how to mess with doors. My place is only a short term answer. You're the best when it comes to this stuff, what do you think?"

Debug stared at Brun for an uncomfortable amount of time while Brun failed to understand the intense look on her face. Brun felt she was being scrutinized, but she didn't know what for. Brun could see Trouble looking back and forth between her and Dee, nervous energy radiating off her.

"We've already been here." Debug finally said as the expression on her face softened and she broke eye contact and started talking at the nurse who was finishing up her checkup. "Deadbolt on the door, bars over the windows, only ground floor windows that can fit a person through, in a lovely suburb." Brun caught on quickly, Debug was talking about Trouble's house.

"You broke in there in seconds, and Frank has a key." Brun tried to not sound like she was shooting down Dee's suggestion, expecting the showmanship that often bid her to ask leading questions like this.

"Yep, that did seem like it was purposely set up to be harder to leave than to enter. The deadbolt being on the outside was the big giveaway there."

Brun saw Trouble look up at her again and feeling less pressure to watch Debug looked down to see if she could glean anything from their expressions. Trouble looked incredibly confused,Brun took a guess what they were thinking based on when they had looked up.

"Deadbolt is supposed to be on the side of the door you want to prevent entry into. If it's on the outside you can just manually slide it through a gap in the latch." Brun turned back to face Debug who already had a hint of a smile on their face. "Yes, Dee, I remember the rant you went on last year about that fire safety door being installed backwards. Do you plan we just take it off it's hinges and turn it around? I also don't want to bully you, but the doctors have been saying you need months of bedrest, when do we plan to do this?" Despite the tense situation, the nurses gave cheerful goodbyes to both of the injured.

"I didn't teach myself how to pick locks." Brun had to strain to hear Dee mumble with the IV pump next to her. "So we'll ask them for help, but they're a bit intense." Debug continued to look away as she spoke 

"Intense how?"

Brun set Trouble down, finally accomplished that all her gym visits were for a good reason. She'd barely broken a sweat carrying her darling creature from the bus stop to the clearly broken apartment door.

(Paragraph about Trouble looking a little faint after a week of not walking)

Debug had been clear she expected things to look like this. Brun had a stab of worry for Beth, they had been here that same night that whoever had tossed Debug's apartment had been. Was the reason why she'd not heard anything from them since then that whoever had hurt Debug had moved on and hurt manager Beth as well?

"Dee gave me these as we were leaving." Brun handed her ward a pair of blue disposable gloves obviously stolen from the hospital. "We don't want to get wrapped up in whatever hellfire Sinéad brings down... actually..." Brun pulled out her phone and dialed Sinead's number, she'd gotten it the week prior while they had been searching for Debug incase they got split up, but it never mattered back then.

The phone rang for a few seconds.

"Who's speaking?" Sinead's voice barked through the phone.

"It's Brunhilde Brown, I'm your daughter's de facto partner." Thinking of her last conversation with Beth; Brun felt she could almost empathize with her as she flexed a connection she knew Sinéad coveted. "Wer're just outside Debug's place and everything is shambles. Have the police finished going through looking for evidence? Dee asked us to drop by and grab something."

Debug couldn't work out how this kept happening. 

The entire reason she had that black book of contacts was cause this kept happening. She thought she must just have a face that screamed 'pester me when I'm alone' cause it had been almost relaxing spending time with Trouble and not being acosted like this.

But without Brun coming to check on her ever half hour, she probably had that look, and one of the nurses had seen it and acted. And now here she was: learning to knit with a nurse at the end of her shift. 

Bonnie, as she had introduced herself much to the agreement of her name tag, sat on the side of Debug's hospital bed holding the ball of yarn and making encouraging noises while Debug struggled.

"So the other nurses were saying you were dating the tall glass of chocolate milk that kept visiting you, but she's also dating another patient. Was she two timing you and you two got into a fight? Did you...lose?" Debug tried to put down the knitting and watched as the last few minutes of work was undone as one needle slipped from her hand and fell entirely out of the tangle of knots. Debug frowned at it.
