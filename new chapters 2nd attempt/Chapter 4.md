Debug stood restless, fingers drumming on the reception desk.

"She didn't even stay to say 'Hi'!" She announced to no one.

"She might have just made a break for it when the rain eased. You saw how bad it got last night." Manager Beth's voice from the back room responded. "When she called about our new Sanctuary it was absolutely coming down in sheets."

"I can't wait for the convention season to start so Bee and I can be on the same shifts again." Debug said while moping, she wanted quite badly to get her twice weekly chance to flirt with the unflappable giantess.

"Actually, since you two are the most senior staff, I'm gonna need you to manage the day and the night shift." Manager Beth interjected. "Why do you think I've been getting you two to specialise and learn how all the ins and outs in the off season? I've got ambitions for the pair of you."

"So have you seen our new charity case?" Debug asked, trying to divert attention away from her boss's schemes. 

"Why are both you and Brun using the worst possible language for this?" Manager Beth asked, now appearing from the back room. "I've not met them, but since their room was empty I checked the cameras and saw they left this morning with Brun. Can't blame them, I'd think myself safe in her arms too."

Debug stood in total shock and was at a loss for words.

Felicity awoke in a panic, fighting a blanket she didn't remember with sirens blaring.

It took a few moments for the situation to become clear. She was fighting with the puffy jacket Brunhilde had given her before. She had gotten the jacket arm caught under herself and had apparently decided it would make a good blanket before dozing off earlier. The incredibly loud sound however seemed to be coming from somewhere else.

Getting up, and as a habit creeping as quietly as she could, to wander around the main room. With minimal investigation, she found the offending noise was coming from Brunhilde's room.

Hesitating at the door, she leaned in and let the sound wash over her, while she trespassed and took in the room. She could see Brun with a pillow in a headlock, sleeping heedless to what was apparently three seperate alarms going off right next to her. 

Feeling like she was breaching some unspoken contract, Trouble crept closer.

She silenced the alarms, and stood at Brun's bedside and tried to prod her in the arm.

"Brun...your alarms went off, and I think you set them to wake you...maybe I shouldn't have stopped them..." Trouble kept gently jostling them. Thinking that if three alarms didn't do the job, their scrawny arms were probably useless too.

Minutes passed and she started to panic. Was Brun ok? Did she always sleep this heavily? We're they unwell? Had they gotten unwell taking care of Trouble when she was essentially an unwanted damp rag? Would they wake up without something loud? Would a shock work instead? What would they find shocking?

Trouble stopped where she was and dismissed the thought that rolled through her mind. She was all skin and bones, it would be more a shock in the sense that it would be unpleasant than surprising. Surprising implies it being welcome in some way. And her body, let alone her lips, wouldn't entice anyone.

Without warning, Brunhilde shifted in her sleep and moved towards the small dent in the bed Trouble kneeling on it caused. When Brun's arm came towards her and grabbed the back of her leg, Felicity did the most obvious course of action. Screamed and fell off the bed with an incredible thump.

Brun awoke frustrated, in her dream a delightful critter had escaped her grasp for a cuddle and she'd been so offended she woke up.

A tearful Trouble was trying to jostle her further awake. Brun didn't want the small thing to worry, so she pulled her into a bear hug. Almost dozing back off, she stroked Trouble's fuzzy short hair and mumbled compliments. She did wonder why Trouble was here and not at their room at the hotel as her memories of yesterday unfurled.

Without releasing the captured lady, who appeared to be mildly smooshed against her bust, Brun stood up and placed Trouble back at arm's length. Awkwardly, patted them on the head, and tried to change the topic.

"Want me to make your breakfast again, Love?"

The whole time Brun cooked Trouble had her namesake as an expression. Brun paused while buttering toast. Trouble wasn't her name was it. That was just what Brun had been calling her. Had she really forgotten Trouble's name? She had been told it earlier, she was sure of it. And unlike normally, she couldn't simply look their name up in the hotel computer because it was under the pseudonym she couldn't stop using.

Brun noticed the piece of toast she was supposed to be buttering had been destroyed by her absent mind and anxious hands and decided she wasn't hungry for toast. 

Focusing more on playing everything up, she put toast on one plate, egg on both, bacon on both, giving herself the bits she liked as benefit of being chef, potato rosti on both plates too, reached for the fork. And managed to, instead of pick it up, launch it like a child with no manner might. Brun watch it sail through the air and land on the tiled floor, sparing her needing to actually clean the carpet since she'd used that fork to do some of the pan cooking.

The clatter of metal on tile rang through the room. Brun turned to Trouble to apologize for the noise, only to see the shadow of fear darken their face. Brun's heart fell out of the bottom of her chest. 

The fear that would drive her to risk her life in that storm.

That would make her check for exits in every room and speak as quiet as possible.

That would force her to live without making a sound or leaving a trace.

That had left all those cruel blemishes on her skin.

That could, in a moment, strike at her heart.

That fear wasn't gone.

Brun found herself already at Trouble's side. Sitting on the arm of the chair they were trying to hide in, silent tears running down their face. One arm clasped around their chest protectively and the other gingerly reaching out to Brun almost fearful to actually touch her. Brun slid into the chair next to Trouble and wrapped them in a hug. 

"Love, I assure you you're safe. Don't worry that you got spooked, it's normal. Just do what you can to relax and we'll go from there." Brun felt this was the first time she'd not put her foot in her mouth reassuring Trouble. It felt unnatural so not be able to see their face, or feel them crying, but know they were incredibly distraught. Rather than actually ask or to to look, Brun would occasionally wipe tears away from their cheek and wait a moment to see if more tears would reappear. 

After a while, which Brun did have to adjust herself a few times during to avoid going back to sleep, Trouble squeezed her hand and Brun too that to mean she was good to not need her snuggling quite as close.

Brun got up and walked back over to the kitchen island, stopping along the way to pick up the dropped fork, and grabbed plates of now cold food for the two of them.

"One of these days I'll give you freshly cooked food." Brun said as she sat down and let the silence of the room then only be broken by the sounds of eating.
