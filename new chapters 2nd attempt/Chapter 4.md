Debug stood restless, fingers drumming on the reception desk.

"She didn't even stay to say 'Hi'!" She complained to no one. "Let alone apologize for taking my uniform." 

"She might have just made a break for it when the rain eased. You saw how bad it got last night." Manager Beth's voice from the back room responded. "When she called about our new Sanctuary it was absolutely coming down in sheets."

Debug didn't want to let a slight go unpunished, but she had an absolute soft spot for Brunhilde. She stood in a uniform that was incredibly oversized for her and tried to not look like a teenager. From what she could piece together, Brun had taken the uniform Debug had left at the hotel instead of the actual spare. The spare was made from terrible synthetic fabrics, so people could change into it when cleaning a room a guest had done terrible things to. And now she had to do a whole shift in it.

She wasn't even sure how Brun could fit her clothes, they were a solid two heads taller than her and broader across the shoulders. Compared to Brun she wasn't anything special, shorter than average and smaller than average and with practiced excuses to justify it. She ran a hand through her short dark blue hair and tried to mentally unruffle her feathers. Her hair colour had started as a test to see at what point people mentioned the colour. But after slowly shifting from dying it black to a vibrant blue and no one mentioning it, she was shifting back to adding more black dye in her wash.

She looked down at herself with a judgmental eye.

"If I was Brun I wouldn't want to hang out with me either." She muttered pulling at the uncomfortable shirt and vest covering her rash of freckles and pale skin. The oversized clothes hiding her lack of feminine features, and making her look like an unloved teen again.

"I can't wait for the convention season to start so Bee and I can be on the same shifts again." Debug said while moping, she had wanted quite badly to get her twice weekly chance to flirt with the unflappable giantess.

"Actually, since you two are the most senior staff, I'm gonna need you to each manage the day and the night shift respectively." Manager Beth interjected. "Why do you think I've been getting you two to specialize and learn how all the ins and outs in the off season? I've got ambitions for the pair of you."

"So have you seen our new charity case?" Debug asked, trying to divert attention away from her boss's schemes. 

"Why are both you and Brun using the worst possible language for this?" Manager Beth asked, now appearing from the back room. "I've not met them, but since their room was empty when I went to introduce myself I checked the cameras and saw they left this morning with Brun. Can't blame them, I'd think myself safe in her arms too."

Beth was Debug's definition of a manager, she assumed someone that looked like them would be found in almost every job. Dark red hair pulled into a serious bun, a long face that ended in sharp cheekbones and a pointed chin. And like any manager she'd known they made everyone's business their business.

Choosing not to answer, Debug settled in for what would likely be their worst shift in a while.

Felicity awoke in a panic, fighting a blanket she didn't remember with sirens blaring.

It took a few moments for the situation to become clear. She was fighting with the puffy jacket Brunhilde had given her before. She had gotten the jacket arm caught under herself and had apparently decided it would make a good blanket before dozing off earlier. The incredibly loud sound however seemed to be coming from somewhere else.

Getting up, and as a habit creeping as quietly as she could, to wander around the main room. With minimal investigation, she found the offending noise was coming from Brunhilde's room.

Hesitating at the door, she leaned in and let the sound wash over her, while she trespassed and took in the room. She could see Brun with a pillow in a headlock, sleeping heedless to what was apparently three separate alarms going off right next to her. Their pajamas had also seemingly traveled, as a good chunk of her upper thigh was exposed and trouble could make out some impressive stomach muscles where their shirt had risen.

Feeling like she was breaching some unspoken contract, Trouble crept closer.

She silenced the alarms, and stood at Brun's bedside and tried to prod her in the arm.

"Brun...your alarms went off, and I think you set them to wake you...maybe I shouldn't have stopped them..." Trouble kept gently jostling them. Thinking that if three alarms didn't do the job, their scrawny arms were probably useless too.

Minutes passed and she started to panic. Was Brun ok? Did she always sleep this heavily? We're they unwell? Had they gotten unwell taking care of her when she was essentially an unwanted damp rag? Would they wake up without something loud? Would a shock work instead? What would they find shocking?

Trouble stopped where she was and dismissed the thought that rolled through her mind. She was all skin and bones, it would be more a shock in the sense that it would be more unpleasant than surprising. Surprising implies it being welcome in some way. And her body, let alone her lips, wouldn't entice anyone.

Without warning, Brunhilde shifted in her sleep and moved towards the small dent in the bed Trouble weight caused. When Brun's arm came towards her and grabbed the back of her leg, Felicity did the most obvious course of action: screamed and fell off the bed with an incredible thump.

*** 

Brun awoke frustrated. In her dream a delightful critter had escaped her grasp for a cuddle and she'd been so offended she woke up.

A tearful Trouble was trying to jostle her further awake. Brun didn't want the small thing to worry, so she pulled them into a bear hug. Almost dozing back off, she stroked Trouble's fuzzy short hair and mumbled compliments. She did wonder why Trouble was here and not at their room in the hotel as her memories of yesterday unfurled.

Without releasing the captured lady, who appeared to be mildly smooshed against her bust, Brun stood up and placed Trouble back at arm's length. Awkwardly, patted them on the head, and tried to change the topic.

"Want me to make your breakfast again, Love?"

The whole time Brun cooked Trouble had her namesake as an expression. Brun paused while buttering toast. 

"Trouble wasn't her name was it." She muttered to herself. That was just what Brun had been calling her. Had she really forgotten Trouble's name? She had been told it earlier, she was sure of it. And unlike normally, she couldn't simply look their name up in the hotel computer because it was under the pseudonym she couldn't stop using.

Brun noticed the piece of toast she was supposed to be buttering had been destroyed by her absent mind and anxious hands and decided she wasn't hungry for toast. 

Focusing more on playing everything up, she put toast on one plate, egg on both, bacon on both, giving herself the bits she liked as benefit of being chef, potato rosti on both plates too. Now starting to clean up she reached for the utility fork she did most of her cooking with, and managed to, instead of pick it up, launch it like a child with no manners might. Brun watched it sail through the air and land on the tiled floor, sparing her from actually having to clean the carpet since she'd used that fork was covered in oil from cooking.

The clatter of metal on tile rang through the room. Brun turned to Trouble to apologize for the noise, only to see the shadow of fear darken their face. Brun's heart fell out of the bottom of her chest. 

The fear that would drive her to risk her life in that storm.

That would make her check for exits in every room and speak as quiet as possible.

That would force her to live without making a sound or leaving a trace.

That had left all those cruel blemishes on her skin.

That could, in a moment, strike at her heart.

That fear wasn't gone.

And it might never be truly gone.

Brun found herself already at Trouble's side. Sitting on the arm of the chair they were trying to hide in, silent tears running down their face. One arm clasped around their chest protectively and the other gingerly reaching out to Brun almost fearful to actually touch her. Brun slid into the chair next to Trouble and wrapped them in a hug. 

"Love, I assure you you're safe. Don't worry that you got spooked, it's normal. Just do what you can to relax and we'll go from there." Brun felt this was the first time she'd not put her foot in her mouth reassuring Trouble. It felt unnatural to not be able to see their face, or feel them crying, but know they were incredibly distraught. Rather than actually ask or try to look, Brun would occasionally wipe tears away from their cheek and wait a moment to feel if more tears would reappear. 

After a while, which Brun did have to adjust herself a few times during to avoid going back to sleep, Trouble squeezed her hand. Brun took that to mean she was good and had her fill of snuggles.

Brun got up and walked back over to the kitchen island, stopping along the way to pick up the dropped fork, and grabbed plates of now cold food for the two of them.

"One of these days I'll give you freshly cooked food." Brun said as she sat down and let the more comfortable silence of eating fill the room.

Debug looked annoyed at her nails, as a single break ran almost entirely across the one she'd been using.

She'd been using it to pry open the key rings that held the hotel security fobs onto their room tags and after a solid hour of work she had finally hit a setback. And without a flathead on hand she'd have to give this project up again.

"Don't look now." Manager Beth said as she burst into the room behind the reception where Debug was working. "But the Mama Bear is back with her cub in tow."

Debug's only reply was a confused look, her mind was still on the previous nonsense Manager Beth had asked her to get started on. 

"Did you spend your break reading tawdry romance novels again? You sound like you ate a crossword puzzle and gained it's powers of being utterly unfathomable." Debug gave up trying to understand what Manager Beth had meant and followed her gesturing hand back to the front desk.

"I just saw Brunhilde rock up with naught but Trouble...yeah why do I talk like that after reading my stories?" Beth was pointing out the front doors at the figures walking through the mostly empty car park.

"And they're holding hands...I'm so jealous. I don't remember Bee ever being that physical. Is this the benefit to telling people your tragic backstory?" 

"That was it!" Beth screamed, causing Debug to recoil away from her. "That's what got me on these books in the first place. You being a dork and implying something tragic happening to you and I said I could guess." Beth slapped her hand on the desk for emphasis.

"Yeah, and you made the bold choice of reading smut. And I think you forgot the point pretty quick after that." Debug retreated to the main open space in the reception both in case Beth yelled again, and also cause she wasn't in a good headspace for talking about herself honestly.

"I still have at least three guesses left. You said I could have five." Beth gripped the top of the reception desk eagerly.

"Five was a mistake, I should have said one and shut this nonsense down years ago."

"Okay, let me think, I can get this. Based on what I know about you now..." While Beth made every thinking noise imaginable, Debug turned away and tried to relax.

Being anxious, even if she said nothing, could imply a correct guess. And then even if she denied Beth's enthusiasm she would never hear the end of it. This was why she had regretted letting Beth pressure her into this game. A flinch or a bad memory could make work unsafe if she couldn't give a good enough excuse fast enough.

Beth stopped making thinking noises.

Debug bit her lip and closed her eyes. Steeling herself.

"Kidnapping?"

"Who's kidnapping? I didn't kidnap Trouble." Bee's voice broke the tension.

Swapping one set of metaphorical armour for another, Debug turned to see Bee with a scrawny lady behind them about the same height as she was and if not for Debug's hair dye they likely had the same hair colour too. The person, who must be Trouble, was looking in corners and seemed uncomfortable standing in the doorway. 

"Like recognizes like." Debug muttered to themself.

Debug walked back over to the reception desk, confident Beth would fall into her work persona and wouldn't get loud anymore. 

"Afternoon Brunhilde." Manager Beth said in her work voice. "And I take it this is our new sanctuary guest you checked in last night?" Debug could feel Beth fighting to not make a pun about the pseudonym Bee had chosen the air practically vibrated with their thoughts.

"Hi." The smallest voice Debug had ever heard answered. They must have been really going through it to sound like that, and their aggressively complete set of bruises and injuries made the same point but louder to Debug's reckoning. She understood why standing in Bee's shadow would help them.

"Come over here to the desk, I'm the manager Beth Ahles I'll be happy to run you through the facilities you can use here and our protocols you can ask for from our helpful staff." 

Debug watched them hesitate to let go of Bee's hand before going to get the lowdown from Manager Beth. With Bee's hands free, Debug swooped in to get a better read on what was going on.

"Taking a lady home before the first date now? Didn't know you had such powerful charisma." Debug lied, not seeing a better way to get a straight answer from someone as honest as Bee than an obvious insult.

"Don't. I couldn't not do something. They looked so in need of help. And I can help. I know people find someone as tall as me off-putting, so if I can ward off some abusive jerk, I'll keep them near me as long as they need." Bee looked hurt, like they had been hounding themself on the same topic and still had no better answer. Their words hurt Debug too, being vulnerable and asking for help was impossible in her mind, and if that was what would take to get Bee's attention...then all her flirting and efforts until now and since would be pointless.

Setting that problem aside forever, Debug swapped modes and started complaining about work.

"Bad jokes aside, Beth says she's essentially never putting us on the same shift again. Says she's gonna train us to be day and night manager or something bogus." Debug pushed Bee's attention back over to her puppy and Manager Beth to give herself a moment to refocus and stay calm. 

"Ohh, is that what she meant when she kept making cryptic comments about future plans. She can just tell us stuff, ya know? Did she get like this from reading those dramatic books of hers?" Brunhilde didn't turn back to face Debug, they simply kept watch as Manager Beth and Trouble spoke.

Debug felt metaphorical another wall raise up between them.

"You're not upset?" She tore the broken nail off and stabbed herself with it to keep her voice even.

"I like the evening shift. I'm not much of a people person like you." Debug very much doubted that fact, especially since they had seemingly gotten someone about as abused as she was to open up and rely on them. Something that even now, knowing that it was apparently safe to do, she would rather keep injuring herself than do.

"Well, I am going to ask about when I'm getting my clothes back. Because this..." Debug struck a pose in the oversized uniform. "...Isn't my clothes. You took my clothes thinking they were this spare."

Brunhilde looked them up and down and made a face that implied she didn't see a difference to what Debug normally dressed like.

"I've left the handover notes on the main reception computer. I'm going home to sleep." Rather than lose her temper, Debug simply left. Taking purposeful strides out of the reception. She both wanted and didn't want Bee to stop her, but she also knew from watching them raise baby birds almost every spring that leaving someone they thought was in need was near impossible.

And come hell or high water, she wouldn't tell anyone about the things that had hurt her. That pain was behind her, and it would stay there.
