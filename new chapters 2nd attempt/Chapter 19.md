Brun stalked through the labyrinth of what she could only assume would be a government office with how many nooks and small rooms and oddly winding corridors she found herself in.

She and Sinéad had immediately split up once they got inside. They hadn't made any plans, just jumped straight into action.

Half of the workers seemed not to care she was on the site and the other half stopped caring once they realised she wasn't their boss. But that ambivalence meant she had no clues to follow. She had seen what had looked like the trail of someone being dragged, but following it had just lead to someone dragging a pair of planks. 

Panic started to set in. 

Debug was missing and injured and now this.

She had just let her anger get the better of her and Trouble had literally been snatched out from under her nose. What was she supposed to do? Could she be trusted to fix this?

"Trouble?" Brun shouted but heard almost all of it bounce straight back at her off all the brick walls and the concrete roof above her.

She'd not seen any way to get up to the floor above her, but the longer she took the more time this bastard had to do so. Brun considered doubling back and trying to search the building again from the entrance in case she'd missed something obvious in her haste, she fully expected at this point to have just blundered losing both of her friends to violence. 

A scream cut through her like a brick through a window.

She hadn't heard that scream in a while. That was Trouble.

Thoughts of searching the entrance again vanished. All thoughts vanished. She didn't know what direction the scream had come from but was already stalking towards where her heart said she would find her friend. 

When she passed another construction worker they were looking the same way she was going. She felt like she was on the right path. As she passed the next pile of construction material she snatched a piece of pipe from it, images of her beating whatever jerk had started this within an inch of their life filled her mind.

Brun found herself at a dead-end. Following her instincts wasn't getting herself any closer and now she was even more lost.
