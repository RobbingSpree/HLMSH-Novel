Brun stalked through the labyrinth of what she could only assume would be a government office someday with how many nooks and small rooms and oddly winding corridors she found herself in.

She and Sinéad had immediately split up once they got inside. They hadn't made any plans, just jumped straight into action.

Half of the workers seemed not to care she was on the site and the other half stopped caring once they realised she wasn't their boss. But that ambivalence meant she had no clues to follow. She had seen what had looked like the trail of someone being dragged, but following it had just lead to someone dragging a pair of planks. 

Gnawing panic started to set in. 

Debug was missing and injured and now this.

She had just let her anger get the better of her and Trouble had literally been snatched out from under her nose. What was she supposed to do? Could she be trusted to fix this?

"Trouble?" Brun shouted but heard almost all of it bounce straight back at her off all the brick walls and the concrete roof above her.

She'd not seen any way to get up to the floor above her, but the longer she took the more time this bastard had to do so. Brun considered doubling back and trying to search the building again from the entrance in case she'd missed something obvious in her haste, she fully expected at this point to have just blundered losing both of her friends to violence. 

A scream cut through her thoughts like a brick through a window.

She hadn't heard that scream in a while. That was Trouble. A scream that was cut short.

Thoughts of searching the entrance again vanished. All thoughts vanished. She was already moving, she didn't know what direction the scream had come from but was already stalking towards where her heart said she would find her friend. 

When she passed another construction worker they were looking the same way she was going. She finally felt like she was on the right path. As she passed the next pile of construction material she snatched a piece of pipe from it, images of her beating whatever jerk had started this within an inch of their life filled her mind.

Brun found herself at a dead-end. Following her instincts wasn't getting herself any closer and now she was even more lost. She backed up to the closest open space and tried to come up with a plan again.

She closed her eyes and strained her ears, trying to focus on any sound that would give her a clue.

The sound of dirt being put in a wheelbarrow. Bricks being stacked. Boots on dusty ground. The slap of a bag of concrete being dropped. The clack of plaster on concrete. A sledge hammer hitting an iron nail. 

Plaster.

Trouble's cast.

Brun turned her head in the direction of the sound trying to get any other clue.

A wet sound. Nothing here was wet. What sounded like mud under a boot. If Trouble was injured she was going to do her best to not murder their assailant, but she would make no promises. If he died, that was the cost.

She stalked towards where she thought she would find Trouble, her heart hammering in her ears.

Another scream tore through her like her fears in the dark.

Her hunter's stalk quickly became a run. Down a long corridor she saw Sinéad also running to the same point, but Brun was closer.

Brun tore around another corner to a small alcove and her heart almost broke.

***

Trouble woke again.

She felt half dead.

She couldn't ignore how blood soaked her clothes were.

The tarp she had hidden under was now stuck to her hip where it had tried to clot.

A noise has roused her.

Her mind felt slow and broken. Her train of thought took a very long time to reach the station. 

She could hear more noise, a scuffle? Talking? Was someone hurt?

Yes, it was her. She had gotten very hurt.

With no one left to help her. She was very hurt.

Someone screamed. Debug's hand closed around the piece of rebar she had grabbed for self defence. She knew that scream.

Was it her own scream? She didn't know a lot of screams? That was wrong, she knew a lot of screams, but had hoped she had forgotten most of them. Was she screaming right now? Had it been her?

Debug was too addled to think straight. Something bad might have happened to her body while she wasn't paying attention. But she couldn't dismiss the scream. It was important.

That scream was trouble.

That scream...was trouble.

Trouble screamed again.

Debug found herself moving. Lurching forward. Casting aside the tarp she had been hiding under. She saw Trouble, a few meters away looking uncomfortable. And bleeding. 

She stopped thinking. Her arm moved with practiced grace. She hurled the rebar at the man standing next to Trouble. He had a knife. Trouble was bleeding. She didn't need to know anything else.

Debug didn't see if her attack landed true. Her legs were entirely spent. Her body was entirely spent. She wanted so badly to be kept safe, but more than that, the urge to keep those she loved safe always won out. It was all she could do to try and put her arm between the hard ground and her head, not even to brace for the fall, just to cushion it a little.

The world went dark again.

***

Felicity flinched away from the knife. It cut worse than she could comprehend. A cruel line of red blossomed on her chest.

She hated pain. She would do anything in her power to avoid it. Old pain could be ignored, constant pain could be diminished, regular pain could be prevented. But fresh pain, she had nothing for.

She had no idea how deep the cut was, but it hurt worse than when the hospital has re-set her her wrist. If she hadn't just emptied her lungs screaming she would still be doing that. 

She heaved a breath, trying to refill her desperate lungs. But doing so pulled at her freshly broken skin, the pain flared like nothing else and panic made her stop.

She looked away, trying to not acknowledge her pain. Trying to focus on anything else, anything that wasn't how hurt she was. Trying to think of any way to breath without her chest. Time felt like it stopped.

The tarp had moved. She was seeing things. In her desperation she must be hallucinating. She thought she could see Bug. Standing proud in a deep red shirt and shorts and what looked like tights. She didn't want to admit she had given up. If she wasn't even hallucinating Brun who she was sure was seeking her out...did she think she could not be found? That Brun hadn't noticed she had been taken? Was the noise of the construction site too loud that she'd been drowned out?

Bug was holding something. 

In their hand was a single piece of rebar. They had such a determined expression, like nothing but Trouble mattered, like nothing existed in the world that wasn't Trouble. Their steely, focused eyes not even looking at Frank. Not even considering him with attention. Did she think that Debug would appear and save her?

Time suddenly felt like it was moving very fast.

Debug threw their weapon and from one moment to the next seemingly vanished. If Frank hadn't flinched and yelled and dropped clutching his side she would have been sure the whole thing was her mind trying to save the last shred of hope.

Brun burst around the corner. Tears in their eyes, a scream already escaping their lips. Brun was also wielding a weapon. They bore down on Frank winding up for a solid kick. Their weapon instantly forgotten and discarded.

"SHE'S HERE!" Brun's attack looked like it caused Frank to shit himself with how much his body appeared to bend around Brun's foot.

Sinéad also appeared from the other direction. Handcuffs already out as she landed on Frank and tried to hold Brun back, stop her from kicking him again. If Trouble wasn't strung up, she would have wanted to get one in too.
Sinéad was trying to say something to Brun. Trying to get them to listen to reason.

A moment of silence fell. Trouble drew a shaky single breath resisting her urge to let that breath escape and to scream again. The pain was very difficult to ignore. Her whole body had far too many complaints for her to comprehend. 

She relaxed for a moment and let her head fall. She stared at the red stain spreading on her shirt. The deep red, already spreading to cover her shirt.

Deep red.

Brun stepped into her vision. With the strength she expected from them they tore the zip tie holding her arms up.

She wanted to fall into Brun's arms. To be soft and safe and secure.

Deep red stains.

She fell to the floor.

Into the puddle of red blood that had just been stolen from her.

"She's hurt!" A horse whisper escaped her mouth along with more blood, the screaming had taken any other words she could say. "She needs help!" An even quieter voice escaped next.

Trouble clawed at the ground, scrambling over to the stained tarp she saw fall before. 

"Trouble, it's okay, you're safe now." Brun tried to reassure her and stop her from moving. "We're here."

"But she's not safe." Trouble failed to say, every part of Felicity's body wanted love and care, to be made safe and whole, to be protected. But more than that...

She reached her friend. The woman that, in this moment, it would not take any hesitation to say she loved. She picked them up and cradled them in her lap. She turned to the other woman she loved. She loved Brun with such a fierce passion, but she needed them to see what had happened.

***

Brun had thought she had finally started to turn things around. 

Moments ago, she had seen who she wanted to call the love of her life in incredible distress. But as soon as she took in the scene her panic turned to exuberance. The villain was doubled over and falling, and Trouble was safe. Her heart had felt like it was going to break moments ago, still felt fragile but remained whole.

She had found the thing she considered the most precious again. Trouble had been found, not safe nor sound but found at the very least. She got a good few kicks in on who she could only assume was Trouble's ex to make sure they didn't get back up any time soon before Sinéad had got in her way of more violence and started trying to wrestle him into a pair of handcuffs instead.

She walked over to Trouble, confident this whole mess was now behind them. The splatter of blood around and on Trouble made Brun want to break a few more of that villain's ribs. Sinéad should be able to lock that stain of a man up for something this obvious. She reached up and with all her adrenaline found the zip tie a feeble match for her strength. 

Brun fully expected to catch Trouble. Being this close, holding her was almost second nature. It was where Brun felt most comfortable.

But they fell to the floor in a pile of exhausted and injured limbs. She had expected Trouble to lean against her, in her arms was always the safest place for Trouble. Brun felt wrong. Had she not just saved Trouble? Were they okay? Obviously not, they were bleeding and dazed. She pulled out her phone to call an ambulance, she couldn't expect a lift in Sinead's car if they were arresting that lout.

"Trouble it's okay, you're safe now." Brun didn't feel like she was telling the truth. She had let Trouble be stolen already, could she really say they were safe? "We're here." Trouble was crawling away with concerning haste.

Was there another assailant about? If they expected to get away with kidnapping someone into a construction site they obviously thought there were allies here who would look the other way. 

"Triple zero, police, fire or ambulance?" The voice in her phone asked.

"Ambulance." Brun muttered as she watched Trouble crawl over to a pile of knocked over bricks and junk. 

"What state are you in?" The voice asked.

"New South...Wales..." 

That wasn't junk.

Trouble lifted something into her lap. 

"Just fucking stay still, you git!" Sinéad complained as the waste-of-space Brun had kicked earlier fought to escape.

Brun instinctively moved closer to Trouble wanting to keep her safe from this monster. 

Brun glanced down at Trouble to make sure she was fine. In that moment Brun's heart, which had done it's best to keep her going through this whole terrible day on no sleep, broke.

At her feet was both women she loved. Both bleeding, both helpless, both holding one another rather than her. 

"Dee?" Brun fell to her knees. Watching as Trouble wiped away tears she kept spilling onto Debug, their hands trying to find something to do to help. Debug's breathing was ragged and labored, her skin was deathly pale and the few rare spots of cream at the top of her sodden red shirt made it clear why she looked so poorly. She had a thin layer of dried blood covering both her legs and despite appearing asleep now looked like she had gotten as little sleep ad Brun had.

"Deh?" Sinead's voice broke Brun's reverie, she sounded as distraught as Brun felt and Trouble looked.

The sounds of a scuffle preceded Sinéad joining them at Dee's side.

"New South Wales emergency service, what's the nature of your call?"

"Uhh, I don't...I don't know...where are we?" Brun couldn't fathom what was going on, all she could do was keep herself from wrapping her two loves in a furious and anguished embrace, she was afraid she would just hurt them further and couldn't trust herself. She clearly hadn't been any help until now.

"Give it." Sinéad snatched the phone from Brun's limp hand. "We're at the construction site on George Street near the Cheap-As-Chips pharmacy in Parramatta, my baby has been bleeding for at least the last seven hours and a second person on site has surface injuries from I think a knife. There's an armed assailant in the area, so inform the Ambos of the risk." She thrust the phone back into Brun's hand and continued. "Describe their injuries and if they give you any instructions follow them. I'm going to call for backup and find out how to get out of here."

Brun felt entirely incapable of following that instruction. But did everything she could nevertheless.
