(need to change Brun's name to Princess following what's said last chapter, maybe also have Brun take on that name then too)

Princess felt uneasily optimistic, trying to enjoy the moment up until the other boot, she knew in her bones was coming, to drop. She stood behind Trouble and played with their uneven hair nervously.

Trouble was sitting in a chair having nurses apply bandage after bandage and handful after handful of salve to her bruises and injuries. Brun had expected a lot harder a time of it, fraud was supposed to be a crime that took planning. Or at least she assumed so until today.

They had come in just as the evening shift started, so the churn of staff handing off might have let them slip through the cracks. Brun could distinctly remember her own version of this. A busy handoff at the hotel that had left a group of three too-polite guests in the reception for two hours before she had thought to ask if they needed to be checked in.

Trouble's left forearm was entirely wrapped in a cast from her knuckle to her elbow. Debug had said to expect a half cast, but the nurses said that since it hadn't been treated swiftly they were going to be safe and put her in a full cast. Trouble and Princess had tried to say the break had happened last night, but the nurses had just given them a stern look and silently started a pantomime about a secondary fracture on the x-ray that implied Trouble's bad fall yesterday had made the break worse instead of cause it. All the while with deadpan faces making the whole scene very surreal.

Brun felt a little bad about not coming straight here after Trouble had first woken up. But that extra day of delay to relax and feel safe she felt was a necessary cost. Or at least. She wanted to think that. The discussion of how old the fracture was did make her feel guilty for not rushing here earlier. But Debug's voice of caution echoed that hospitals and shelters were the first places an abusive ex would search and their extra steps of trickery would keep Trouble safe.

As she worried back and forth repeated in her mind, Princess was brought back to the present when she noticed one of the nurses beckoning her over. She pointed to herself and nodded and then pointed to Trouble and shook her head.

The beckoning nurse silently agreed.

Princess absent-mindedly kissed the top of Trouble's head and made to walk over to the nurse.

"I'll be back in a sec, Love. This won't take a minute." Princess said to make sure Trouble understood she was going to come back and wasn't just bored and leaving.

Once out of view from Trouble she walked straight to the nurse who had retreated to one of the computers scattered in the Emergency Ward. 

"What's going on then?" Princess asked, trying to keep her voice casual.

"So I've just got some follow up questions for the record of your friend's stay today." Princess nodded, trying to not show her worry. "So how long have they been short?"

Princess blinked.

She tried to remember what the question she was just asked was and if it made any sense.

Short? 

Trouble had always been short...right? Except when she was a child.

"What?" Was all Princess could ask in response.

"Cause our record for Brunhilde Brown has her listed as six foot two...which..." They paused dramatically and looked up at Brun. "Is about as big as you appear to be."

When did they get her height? 

Brun focused, trying to recall any time she had come to a hospital. Vague memories of getting stitches for when she'd fallen at work while holding glass vases full of flowers for some stuck up guest.

Brun was unsure what to do now, sure they were rumbled, but this nurse didn't seem like they were going to do anything malicious.

"That sure is a coincidence. Wouldn't think that would come up with an arm fracture." Brun tried playing it cool.

"Wrist fracture." They said flatly, pointing to the screen she couldn't see. "Sorry, but if you come in looking like your racist uncle tried to forcibly remove the gay with a lead pipe, we're gonna check if you've had a history of visits. And when it described you as indigenous and the patient looked like a blank canvas that had been attacked by fruit cart we checked a few other details."

Brun did her best to not look guilty.

"Look..." They sighed heavily. "I assume you're trying to not leave a paper trail, yes?" They didn't look particularly annoyed, Brun hoped this wasn't the other boot dropping on her. She nodded.

"She's got an abusive ex, she's currently hiding at my place. Their ex has police contacts, so they might ask for stuff in a way that seems innocuous just to stalk her." Brun parroted what Debug had said earlier when she'd asked similar questions.

"Hmmm...ok, but YOU still want a paper trail you can get for the assault and abuse charges to stick later for a restraining order. No paper trail, gives you nothing to work with, we just need to leave it in such a way you can get this later and they can't if they don't know what to look for." The pair stood quietly while thinking, Brun had no idea to contribute but tried to look contemplative just in case. "I'm gonna have a chat with the floor manager, stay here."

Brun stayed where she was, listening to the various people in the emergency ward complain or chat. The constant beeps and machine noises and quiet walking all muffled by the hanging curtains, made the large floor feel quite intimate. She could make out Trouble's squeaky voice saying something to the nurse in with her. But before she could properly focus on that, the nurse she was talking to returned.

"Okay, so after a bit of testing, we can put a note on this visit saying that it was assigned to the wrong patient, and 'we'll update the record later'." They used finger quotes to indicate sarcasm. "That way, you can grab it later and we can put it on the correct patient record. Essentially letting us hide it for now."

Brun breathed a sigh of relief. With the nurses on their side, she just had to hope talk about this wouldn't spread. 

"But..." The nurse continued. "I need the patient's actual name. So we can put it in the notes, ya know?"

Brun reached for Trouble's wallet, since they had swapped wallets as part of their disguise. She hoped this wasn't just a clever ruse to put Trouble in danger. Brun was impressed with how paranoid she was being, she normally didn't think this hard about other people's intentions.

"Felicity Harbor." Brun said, as she learned the fact herself.

"Actually, if you've got her wallet, let me grab the Medicare card and I can add that in case there's someone else with the same name." The nurse said, picking the wallet put of Brun's hand.

***

Trouble felt exhausted and spent, she was stiff from all her new cast and bandages and trying to get used to not moving in a way the bandages discouraged.

The nurses had done a very thorough job of finding and cataloging every bruise she had. After they were sure she had a fracture in her arm, they'd checked her over again in case she had another somewhere else she had also been neglecting.

She knew Brun had seen her naked, cause she had needed to take off her wet clothes, but being awake while someone inspected every inch of you for signs of injury was embarrassing. And she didn't want to make a fuss, but also, she had very embarrassing thoughts about Princess while she had been stripping down. Did she want them to look? Did she not? Did she want them to also be embarrassed? It was a lot.

And most of all, was the nurse who'd been vocally jealous about her near lack of a bust. It wasn't something she'd had to address in the past, Trouble had not had opportunities for making friends by the time kids her age were growing boobs. So her lack of them and tendency to not wear a bra hadn't come up. She had just assumed everyone else didn't wear them either. And now she was overly conscious that Brun was wearing one now. They hadn't been wearing one last night when they dramatically dove through their loungeroom, but the less she thought about that the better.

Actually, Trouble noted they were avoiding thinking about a lot of stuff. But she could deal with it all in time. 

Brun continued to steer her into the hotel carpark, she'd still not learned how to get here without a storm pushing her most of the way.

"So I've got Monday's off. Do you work Monday? If be happy to hang out either way." Brun asked, deciding to break the comfortable silence they'd been walking in.

Trouble stopped walking and Brun almost knocked them over as they tried to guide her into the hotel reception.

Monday.

Her job.

Shed been avoiding thinking about that too!

How was she going to do her job?

She didn't even have her phone and didn't know her boss's number. She had done the normal thing and entrusted it to the storage on her phone. But without it...

She was going to be fired.

She would lose her job. 

Have no way to pay back Brun or the hotel.

Have to choose between being homeless or going back to Frank and probably being murdered.

Felicity felt her legs give way.

But she didn't land on anything.

Someone had snatched her out of the air as she fell, and was trying to get her to stand.

Her face was wet.

Something was rubbing her head.

A lot of noises were washing over her.

More people came by.

They asked questions.

So she answered.

Debug was exhausted, running on fumes and whatever food she had just smuggled out of the kitchen.

"So are you going to explain what's going on? This isn't a guessing game anymore." Beth asked, clearly cross. Debug had almost been caught taking food, not that taking the food was a thing they weren't allowed to do, but if Beth caught wind she wasn't taking good enough care of herself she'd never stop trying to metaphorically adopt her. Some of the seasonal staff had complained to her about it as a reason they wouldn't continue working with the hotel after the convention and tourism season. If it was bad enough to drive people away from an easy job, Debug assumed it was too much for her.

"I had a migraine and took a day course on 'how to handle stalker exs'" She lied, the words coming out as naturally as they did, because she sounded as exhausted and done with the day as she was. "You just don't give them a reason to not be a weirdo until you need them to leave, and you don't have anyone do it, just make their scummy behaviour too difficult to hide. They'll fuck off by themselves and are less inclined to return."

Manager Beth didn't look convinced. But she also looked out of steam. She normally went home once the evening shift started. And now seems she was determined to finish the hand over with Debug and sleep in the hotel rather than go home. 

Debug was just waiting for the morning shift staff to come back from the nap room where they'd gone to change. Looking for a way to give Beth the slip, she glanced around and spotted the ladies of the hour in the parking lot. 

"Here comes Trouble." Debug announced and walked out the front door to greet them. They were easily the best excuse she could ask for.

As she walked towards the pair, Bee took Trouble in her arms and hugged her. She was covering a shift and they were off flirting? incensed, she stormed closer to give them a piece of her mind. As she got closer she could make out the cast Trouble had got, and the absolute litany of bandages and gauze the hospital staff had wrapped her in. They looked like they were recovering from burns rather than abuse.

Debug got within spitting distance, but before she could spit any insults, she noticed Trouble wasn't standing, not Bee hugging her. Bee was trying to hold Trouble aloft, while Trouble simply didn't use her legs. They also didn't seem to be very present, eyes unfocused and silently weeping.

"Crime Commisioner here..." Debug announced, trying to use abstract details to reel Trouble back into the present. "What can I do to help?"

"Break into my house and steal my stuff." Trouble replied, her voice unnaturally calm and mismatched to her current actions.

"I can do that." Debug said as clearly as possible. Regardless of how difficult it would actually be, Trouble needed hear good news. "You came here on foot, we can be there and back with your stuff in under an hour." Brun was giving her all kinds of confused looks, but Debug justed waved a hand trying to wordlessly imply things would be fine.

Doing some quick mental math on the quickest way to get all three of them into the seized car, Debug pointed to the lonely car at the far end of the carpark.

"That blue car over there, is one the hotel owns. Some idiot got caught doing crimes while staying here and the police forgot to impound the car, and when no one ever came back for it, we claimed it as our own. Technically the hotel owns it." She continued waving at Bee hoping she'd get a chance later to give her the full story. "I'll run inside and grab the keys we'll drive to your place scope it out and steal everything not nailed down you want." She leaned a little closer to Bee and whispered. "Do what you can to get her focused on the present and either get her address or span her out of this entirely, I'll be right back."

Without waiting for a response Debug took off at a run. Not her casual run she used when hurrying around the hotel, her full speed dead sprint. This was serious enough a shock to her system that she was now running on fumes and adrenaline. If she could keep it going she'd have enough focus to pick a random door lock and have Brun driver them all back to the hotel.

She came to a stop near the front door, waiting for it to open enough for her to sidle through. She swiftly stripped her black vest and unbottened the top two shirt buttons to let her body breathe. While Manager Beth was talking to the day staff, a weedy looking man she never bothered to learn the name of, Debug snuck behind the reception desk, opened a draw and grabbed the car key and her pick kit.

"Taking the car for a spin to do crimes, don't wait up." She half shouted to Beth, before racing back out the front door before it timed out and closed.
