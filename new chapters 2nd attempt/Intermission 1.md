"That's not enough food, Trouble." Debug's voice cut through her focus. Looking up she watched as her friend grabbed several bread rolls and put them on her plate as well. "Simply looking at you makes me hungry, you need to eat more too." They were likely correct, but as Trouble watched them pick more food to put on her plate she noticed a trend.

"Is this just carbs?" The question snuck out before she could stop herself.

"What? No, it's also Potatoes." The silence hung in the air as Trouble tried to work out of this was a joke.

"Debug...do you know what carbs are?" A smile threatened to play over her lips.

"It's...it's food? Like meat and gravy?" Their normal confidence entirely gone from their voice. "Brun's the one you want to ask these sorts of things. Food doesn't need all these names and words."

"Debug do...do you just eat stuff like this? Rice, potatoes and bread?" She asked trying to lead them over to a table to sit and chat more. It was very enlightening to find a topic Debug wasn't well versed on.

"Well...you just need vegetables, grains and fiber for a balanced diet. And that's what this is." As debug sat down with their plate Trouble noted how carb heavy it was. They had clearly tried to grab some meat at the last second too as they also had the pan fried Whiting. But that did mean everything on their plate was pale or white in colour.

"I also don't know the specifics, but I know rice, bread and Potatoes all fall under that category. We should ask Brun to explain it properly, I'd hate for your diet to cause you to waste away."

"Once you get some meat on your bones and catch up to me in the bust department, then you can tell me what to eat...as we join forces against Brun's bust."

"Speaking of Brun..."

"I'm concerned how this connects to what I just said." Debug interjected.

"She told me a few times on the first day we met to call her by the shortened version of her name. But I'm still using your full name." Trouble watched Debug's face trying to glean an answer before they said a response.

"I've not been hearing you call me Miss Nolastnam. But I get your point." Debug waved a dismissive hand before continuing. "When I first started here it was just after I changed my name and I was a little shy about my mischievous name so I told them to call me Dee, cause it was what I was used to." Trouble tried to take note of that, as Debug was pretty sparse with details about themselves.

"Then...if they knew you at the start and call you by the first part of your name...I'll call you Bug cause we met at the end of my struggles." Trouble tried to smile reassuringly at Bug.

"We'll probably still have struggles, but you're not alone anymore Snugglepup."
