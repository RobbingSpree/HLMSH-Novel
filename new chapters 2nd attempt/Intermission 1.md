Debug insists

---

"That's not enough food, Trouble." Debug's voice cut through her focus. Looking up she watched as her friend grabbed several bread rolls and put them on her plate as well. "Simply looking at you makes me hungry, you need to eat more." They were likely correct, but as Trouble watched them pick more food to put on her plate she noticed a trend.

"Is this just carbs?" The question snuck out before she could stop herself.

"What? No, it's also Potatoes." The silence hung in the air as Trouble tried to work out of this was a joke.

"Debug...do you...know what carbs are?" A smile threatened to play over her lips.

"It's...it's food? Like meat and gravy?" Their normal confidence entirely gone from their voice. "Brun's the one you want to ask these sorts of things. Food doesn't need all these names and words."

"Debug do...do you just eat stuff like this? Rice, potatoes and bread?" She asked trying to lead them over to a table to sit and chat more. It was very enlightening to find a topic Debug wasn't well versed on.

"Well...you just need vegetables, grains and fiber for a balanced diet. And that's what this is." As debug sat down with their plate Trouble noted how carb heavy it was. They had clearly tried to grab some meat at the last second too as they also had the pan fried Whiting. But that did mean everything on their plate was pale or white in colour.

"I also don't know the specifics, but I know rice, bread and Potatoes all fall under the category of carbs. We should ask Brun to explain it properly, I'd hate for your diet to cause you to waste away."

"Once you get some meat on your bones and catch up to me in the bust department, then you can tell me what to eat...as we join forces against Brun's bust."

"Speaking of Brun..."

"I'm concerned how this connects to what I just said." Debug interjected.

"She told me a few times on the first day we met to call her by the shortened version of her name. But I'm still using your full name." Trouble watched Debug's face trying to glean an answer before they said a response.

"I've not been hearing you call me Miss Nolas'nam like some of the staff here do. But I get your point." Debug waved a dismissive hand before continuing. "When I first started here it was just after I changed my name and I was a little shy about my mischievous name so I told them to call me Dee, cause it was what I was used to." Trouble tried to take a mental note of that, as Debug was pretty sparse with details about themselves.

"Then...if they knew you at the start and call you by the first part of your name...I'll call you Bug cause we met at the end of my struggles." Trouble tried to smile reassuringly at Bug.

"We'll probably still have more struggles, but you're not struggling alone anymore."

Brunhilde questions

---

"Gary, can I have a moment?" Brunhilde strode down the hall after her quarry.

"Miss Brown, how can I help you?" Gary was a weedy looking bloke, like he grew tall and then stopped growing entirely, he didn't have the muscles to match like Brun did.

"I heard you worked the Monday, I just had a question about that shift." Now that she'd cornered the one person who was working the day she saw Debug making out with someone behind the reception desk she couldn't actually think of how to broach the topic.

"The complaints from that morning were from people who got blasted by the flood lights being turned on. But that was something Miss Nolas'nam did with Manager Beth. I thought you'd be across that."

"No, this was about something later, during your shift. A bit of a delicate matter..." Brun tried to ask the question with her eyebrows, now suddenly shy about asking Gary directly and a little ashamed she didn't have the confidence to talk to Dee herself about the matter.

"Delicate...?" Gary looked clueless for a moment before realization spread over his face. "Right! Yeah, she's done stuff like that before, not sure why she likes announcing it like that."

"Thanks, just wanted to make sure it was you. Thanks for your help Gary." Brun could tell she was blushing. Did she not like that Debug was kissing staff? Or that Gary had said they often announced it. Confused and embarrassed she strode off at top speed, not listening to Gary call out after her.

"What crimes did she need the car for?"

Trouble ponders

---

Trouble sat in the quiet of her room waiting for Brun to come by.

A lot of her time was spent like this. In contemplative silence while alone.

When she had first tried sitting alone in the room she gave up after an hour. But now she was a lot more comfortable with the space. What had previously felt like a large set of rooms with more space than she could fill, had turned into essentially several small rooms where most of the walls dividing them had mysteriously vanished.

The high backed arm chair in the corner. She could turn it to face the corner and suddenly had a very comfortable replacement for the cupboard she used to hide in at home if she needed to have the certainty of an enclosed space.

The space between the bed and the curtain. A quiet space, with the draping fabric off the bed and the curtains it made all sound muffled and was a more comforting spot to have a nap than the enormous bed.

The floor in the kitchenette was cool and clean. The benches around it were high and sitting or laying on the floor there felt like being at the bottom of a cool rocky ravine. When her mind or memories turned on her, replaying how Frank would prowl her house, how he'd joke about how trapped she was, how he admitted to being the cause of her break in that had prompted the extra security he installed. That despite growing taller, she was still the height of the children still in school and just as easy to trick. That her friends now had similar machinations, just waiting for her to be complacent to take advantage of her as everyone she could recall did before.

Even with all that.

The cool tiled floor on her skin. The sharp echo of the space. The light rap of her cast tapping on the floor as she lifted it and let it fall.

It was reassuringly solid and real. It filled her senses. Let her relax and let sensation fill her mind, drowning out the chatter of a voice that at all costs wanted to keep her safe. Even if it was jumping at shadows.

She knew other people might think her odd, to want to use so much of her room at floor level or curled in a ball. To struggle so hard just to struggle again in short order. To stay so low simply to avoid getting hurt from falling.

But the moments when she let her friends into the space. When it felt safe to be standing, when she could be confidant she would be caught if she fell. It breathed new life into her.

After a week she had noticed something. A change. Her entire right forearm was blemish and bruise free.

She had averted her eyes from her own body so often in shame for how poorly she and everyone else treated her body. It was odd to be able to look at herself and see a person again.

She hoped her new friends saw the same.
