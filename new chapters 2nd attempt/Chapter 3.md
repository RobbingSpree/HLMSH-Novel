Brun snorted and her whole body twitched as she jerked back awake.

"Not yet." She announced as she pulled herself back from sleep, adrenalin pumping as she panicked and her mind tried to remember what she had been doing before she let herself relax. Trouble turned to look at her with concern, holding what appeared to be the remains of an avocado they'd eaten with nothing but a fork.

"I have to..." Brun almost finished her sentence announcing her need to leave, before her previous words haunted her. She could just tell Trouble she wouldn't leave her alone only to do exactly that. She decided to simply work out what she needed aloud, since her mind was still delirious with lust for sleep.

"Bathe. And change. I've got back to back shifts today and tomorrow. I normally head home for food, fresh uniform, a nap and a shower...in the reverse of that order between the shifts. But I said I wasn't going to leave you alone. That I'd keep you safe." Brun paused while trying to think, when she found no thoughts coming she simply started talking again, just in case she was holding her thoughts in her mouth rather than her mind. "Do you want to come home with me?"

Brun was consumed by a complex set of emotions, where did she get off asking the abuse survivor if they wanted to come to her house? Sure, at this point she would very likely start choose violence to protect Trouble. But they wouldn't know that. She did her best to not voice her own self directed criticism and turned to look at Trouble for how they were taking her insane ramblings. Brun looked Trouble in the eyes for the first time since they'd left the nap room and saw the same wet eyed look of hopeful trust she saw from the cats who kept stealing her sandwiches.

Brun screamed internally while making her mind up before standing up and reaching out a hand to Trouble.

"I've got a book nook I think you'd really enjoy."

Felicity let herself be lead by the hand, she left like a poorly strung puppet that had just woke up.
