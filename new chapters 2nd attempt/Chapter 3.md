Brun snorted and her whole body twitched as she jerked back awake.

"Not yet!" She announced as she pulled herself back from sleep, adrenalin pumping as she panicked and her mind tried to remember what she had been doing before she let herself relax. Trouble turned to look at her with concern, holding what appeared to be the remains of an avocado they'd eaten with nothing but a fork.

"I have to..." Brun almost finished her sentence announcing her need to leave, before her previous words haunted her. She could just tell Trouble she wouldn't leave her alone only to do exactly that. She decided to simply work out what she needed aloud, since her mind was still delirious with lust for sleep.

"Bathe. And change. I've got back to back shifts today and tomorrow. I normally head home for food, fresh uniform, a nap and a shower...in the reverse of that order between the shifts. But I said I wasn't going to leave you alone. That I'd keep you safe." Brun paused while trying to think, when she found no thoughts coming she simply started talking again, just in case she was holding her thoughts in her mouth rather than her mind. "Do you want to come home with me?"

Brun was consumed by a complex set of emotions, where did she get off asking the abuse survivor if they wanted to come to her house? Sure, at this point she would very likely start choose violence to protect Trouble (even if the spare uniform she was wearing would pop every button and half the seams if she did). But they wouldn't know that. She did her best to not voice her own self directed criticism and turned to look at Trouble for how they were taking her insane ramblings. Brun looked Trouble in the eyes for the first time since they'd left the nap room and saw the same wet eyed look of hopeful trust she saw from the cats who kept stealing her sandwiches.

Brun screamed internally while making her mind up before standing up and reaching out a hand to Trouble.

"I've got a book nook I think you'd really enjoy."

Felicity let herself be lead by the hand, she left like a poorly strung puppet that had just woke up.

Brunhilde had spent the last hour or so since she'd woken up being the fantasy ideal of a gallant knight while she did her best to not cry. She didn't know why she needed to cry, things were seemingly fine. She was warm, clothed, fed, and had a literal bodyguard. She should be feeling relaxed and happy. Why couldn't she just be fine?

Felicity, or as Brunhilde had been calling her (and seemed to suit what she felt like she brought to the table): Trouble, looked up at the tall woman leading her through the long corridors of the hotel. Their skin was a wonderful deep shade that seemed to magically change colour under the different lights of the halls and rooms. Felicity was a little jealous, since her own pallor simply made her look to be afflicted with different harrowing diseases under various artificial light sources.

As she watched the hypnotic swap of Brunhilde's braids, Felicity realized she'd been brought behind the reception desk.

"We're lucky I got some emergency wellies last week when the weather first started to look sus." Brunhilde held out a pair of glitter covered wet weather boots and a pair of thick socks she'd pulled out from behind the desk with an enthusiastic grin.

While keeping hold of Brunhilde's hand at all times, she folded her gangly body and slipped on the footwear before being handed a jacket.

"Actually, I really should work out how much of my rain gear is here if I've got one for both of us and I'm still leaving another spare behind."

Brun took her hand back.

Handed Felicity a puffy jacket.

Donned a second one herself.

Before offering her hand again to lead Felicity further.

Felicity put an arm through and the hood on, but had already taken Brunhilde's hand again so let the holding arm hang out of the coat rather than let go again. Felicity didn't want to dwell on how much she was using Brunhilde's kindness to keep going. The jacket smelt aggressively dry and of olives. 

As her knight lead her towards the reception door, the early morning hint of a sunrise slipping under the edge of the storm and peaking through as the last of the storm moved on. The door opened, only for the wind she'd not been paying attention to tried to blow her back into the reception proper.

Brunhilde stepped back and let the door automatically close again, before pulling Felicity into a spin and lifting their connected left hands over her head. With the move complete she found herself in the crook of Brunhilde's arm. Brunhilde started to walk back to the door and with their arm protectively around her, Felicity was able to walk almost normally out into the car park again.
