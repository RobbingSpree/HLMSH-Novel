Brun snorted and her whole body twitched as she jerked back awake.

"Not yet!" She announced as she pulled herself back from sleep, adrenalin pumping as she panicked and her mind tried to remember what she had been doing before she let herself relax. Trouble turned to look at her with concern, holding what appeared to be the remains of an avocado they'd eaten with nothing but a fork.

"I have to..." Brun almost finished her sentence announcing her need to leave, before her previous words haunted her. She could just tell Trouble she wouldn't leave her alone only to do exactly that. She decided to simply work out what she needed aloud, since her mind was still delirious with lust for sleep.

"Bathe. And change. I've got back to back shifts today and tomorrow. I normally head home for food, fresh uniform, a nap and a shower...in the reverse of that order between the shifts. But I said I wasn't going to leave you alone. That I'd keep you safe." Brun paused while trying to think, when she found no thoughts coming she simply started talking again, just in case she was holding her thoughts in her mouth rather than her mind. "Do you want to come home with me?"

Brun was consumed by a complex set of emotions, where did she get off asking the abuse survivor if they wanted to come to her house? Sure, at this point she would very likely start choose violence to protect Trouble (even if the spare uniform she was wearing would pop every button and half the seams if she did). But they wouldn't know that. She did her best to not voice her own self directed criticism and turned to look at Trouble for how they were taking her insane ramblings. Brun looked Trouble in the eyes for the first time since they'd left the nap room and saw the same wet eyed look of hopeful trust she saw from the cats who kept stealing her sandwiches.

Brun screamed internally while making her mind up before standing up and reaching out a hand to Trouble.

"I've got a book nook I think you'd really enjoy."

Felicity let herself be lead by the hand, she left like a poorly strung puppet that had just woke up.

Brunhilde had spent the last hour or so since she'd woken up being the fantasy ideal of a gallant knight while she did her best to not cry. She didn't know why she needed to cry, things were seemingly fine. She was warm, clothed, fed, and had a literal bodyguard. She should be feeling relaxed and happy. Why couldn't she just be fine?

Felicity, or as Brunhilde had been calling her (and seemed to suit what she felt like she brought to the table): Trouble, looked up at the tall woman leading her through the long corridors of the hotel. Their skin was a wonderful deep shade that seemed to magically change colour under the different lights of the halls and rooms. Felicity was a little jealous, since her own pallor simply made her look to be afflicted with different harrowing diseases under various artificial light sources.

As she watched the hypnotic swap of Brunhilde's braids, Trouble realized she'd been brought behind the reception desk.

"We're lucky I got some emergency wellies last week when the weather first started to look sus." Brunhilde held out a pair of glitter covered wet weather boots and a pair of thick socks she'd pulled out from behind the desk with an enthusiastic grin.

While keeping hold of Brunhilde's hand at all times, she folded her gangly body and slipped on the footwear before being handed a jacket.

"Actually, I really should work out how much of my rain gear is here if I've got one for both of us and I'm still leaving another spare behind."

Brun took her hand back.

Handed Felicity a puffy jacket.

Donned a second one herself.

Before offering her hand again to lead Felicity further.

Trouble put an arm through and the hood on, but had already taken Brunhilde's hand again so let the holding arm hang out of the coat rather than let go again. Trouble didn't want to dwell on how much she was using Brunhilde's kindness to keep going. The jacket smelt aggressively dry and of olives. 

As her knight lead her towards the reception door, the early morning hint of a sunrise slipping under the edge of the storm and peaking through as the clouds moved on. The door opened, only for the wind she'd not been paying attention to tried to blow her back into the reception proper.

Brunhilde stepped back and let the door automatically close again, before pulling Trouble into a spin and lifting their connected left hands over her head. The only thing she saw as she was being spun was a proud little smile on Brunhilde's face. With the move complete she found herself held close in the crook of their arm. They started to walk back to the door and with their arm protectively around her, Trouble was able to walk almost normally out into the car park again.

The wind still pushed and blew like it had last night, but without the rain lashing her skin and a protective layer on and her guardian by her side it was actually pleasant. She looked up at Brunhilde and watched as the loose braid she had been watching sway back and forth earlier flailed in the gale like an angry snake. They seemed to notice her gaze and looked down and tried to say something but the wind was far louder, apparently noticing her confusion they simply pointed instead to a nearby bus stop they were walking towards.

Once they made it to the shelter of the bus stop and the wind simply tugged at the hem of her pants rather than tried to inflate her jacket like a kite. Brunhilde pulled her to sit on their lap in the only dry part of the accompanying bench.

"The wind still wants to knock you down, Trouble. But don't worry, I'll keep you safe." Wrapping their other arm around Trouble and covering them slightly with their own rain jacket. Trouble in turn, feeling like a spoiled kid undeserving of this kindness, nestled closer and rested her head on their soft chest.

Warmth.

Soft relaxing warmth.

Trouble didn't think she could have comprehended this unless she experienced it. She had thought their favorite pillow was soft, but that was nothing compared to where she was leaning on Brun. And the warmth was something else, with both of Brun's arms around her and the outside world almost entirely cut off, all she could hear was the soft heartbeat through Brun's shirt. Focusing only on that, she let her mind wander.

Time passed and she felt herself being lifted a little and Brun jostling her. trouble came to her senses when she realized Brun was putting her down on her own feet and the world swayed. Because she had dozed off a bit and not noticed Brunhilde bodily lifting her up to carry her onto the bus. Trouble felt herself flush red with embarrassment and couldn't look at Brunhilde for the entire ride, instead moving to stand behind her so she could avoid being looked at as well.

She felt conflicted on if she should stop holding Brunhilde's hand also. This entire trip, it seemed like they were taking care to be holding her hand at all times, and while Trouble felt like she didn't deserve to be treated this gently - like a baby bird with bones that would fracture in the wind - she couldn't bare to take her own hand back. To break that connection. As her emotions roiled, she had the urge to tug her hand away and scream, but when she didn't act and the feeling melted away again Trouble was just left with a sense of unease.

She was jolted back to the present when the driver decided to slam on the breaks. Trouble bounced off Brunhilde and almost fell to the floor, letting go of her hand as she braced for injury again. When it didn't come, she opened her eyes to find Brunhilde had snatched her out of the air to save her again. Sounds of a brief argument barely registered as Trouble was overwhelmed with visions of Brunhilde in a knight's armor rescuing her from a monster.

Only realizing the argument must have been between Brunhilde and the driver when they lead her off the bus and walked them a short distance to the next bus stop and beyond it to a block nondescript of apartments.

***

Brun was doing her absolute best to stay awake, fighting a losing battle.

Her legs felt like uncooked dough, her mind felt like it had rusted over, and she was vigorously holding onto Trouble as a ward against sleeping. And her ward simply made her want to sleep more.

In her sleep addled daze, she was thinking more and more that Trouble was just like a cuddly little animal, one she was allowed by her lease to take into her apartment and fluff and pet and hug.

Autopiloting through the entrance to her building and over to the elevator, Brun saw a reflection of the two of them standing together. She realized she had almost entirely absorbed Trouble into her jacket. The smaller lady barely came up to her chest, and probably while they bumbled out of the bus, she had bundled them into her jacket. Their expression was unreadable due to being both half covered by her jacket and swimming in the puffer jacket Brun had put on Trouble when they left.

Brun focused intently on the floor indicator for the lift, attempting to banish thoughts of petting Trouble like some kind of adorable puppy. 

Had she cleaned her apartment recently?

Had she made a mess when she left?

Was she holding Trouble too tight?

Did she have energy to jump in the shower for a quick wash?

Did she smell bad now?

Trouble was right under her armpit and hadn't said anything. 

What did Trouble smell like?

Brun caught herself moving. She had lowered her head down and had been about to sniff her ward. Seized by the knowledge they were standing in front of a large reflective surface they froze in place and struggled to think of a way to extract themselves without being weird or mentioning what she had almost done.

"You smell like rain, Trouble." Brun's mouth said as it betrayed her. She closed her eyes, stood back up straight and screamed internally.

She heard the ding of the lift arriving, the trundle of the doors opening, and blindly walked both of them into the lift, punching her floor button with practiced ease. Her external tranquility a mask over the non-verbal berating she was giving herself.

An familiar noise returned her to the present. It came from near her hip. Looking down, Brun's brain kicked back into gear and realized Trouble must have said something and she was too wrapped up in herself to hear.

"Pardon, Love?"

"I said, you smell nice too. Like fruits and..." Their voice trailing off toward the end, but Brun empathized with how embarrassing it would be to have to say that twice so she assumed she had the gist.
