Her sleep was deep and dreamless. She almost didn't notice that she had woken up as there was almost no ambient noise.

Felicity lurched up, reaching for her bedside table to brace against and sit up, a pounding headache and general body ache assailing her as her all at once to let her know that moving was a bad idea. Leaning on the bedside table was also a bad idea because it wasn't there, and this wasn't her bedroom.

She cursed as she fell to the ground on thin carpet. Carpet she'd never seen before. 

Where was she?

How did she get here?

The last she remembered...

She had fled.

It had rained.

It had really rained.

She'd been buffeted by the winds and knocked onto the road.

And had tried to reach...

Her head whipped around to find she was in a very small room, about the size she expected a cell to be, with barely any furnishings. A mirror, the bed she'd fallen out of, a closed door, a chair that had her clothes folded up on, a desk phone not living up to it's name on the floor, and herself on the floor tangled in several cotton blankets.

She had a double take at her clothes on the chair and realized she wasn't wearing any clothes. Someone had stripped her while she slept, a sickening feeling of violation crept over her. Frank's stories about his police friends and them functionally abducting women out of shelters came to mind.

Knowing she would be better prepared for what came next by actually wearing her clothes, so she grabbed her pants an jammed her legs into them. Followed by grabbing her shirt.

She took a moment to pause, as her senses slowly told her something nice had happened. Her legs were wrapped in a glorious warmth she'd not known for years. Her clothes felt like they'd just come out of the tumble dryer, or had sat to warm in front of a fire. They were wonderfully toasty and soft. Except her butt, as she noticed her underwear was still damp.

Felicity heard the door she had yet to investigate open, and quick as a flash held her shirt up to cover her petite chest and modesty while staying facing away from it.

"Morning Trouble, I'm glad to see you up on your feet after last night. Let me get a look at you." A voice with a gentle rasp she didn't know spoke behind her. Felicity checked to see if the mirror showed who had come in, but it pointed the wrong way. Before she think further, rough, work-worn hands gripped her shoulders and bid her to turn around and she prepared to defend herself.

Once turned around, Felicity found herself staring at the clavicle and neck of a dark skinned woman. Looking up, she found herself staring harder at the face of that woman. A warm smile, kind eyes, and a single braid that had escaped the bun of them atop her head. The stark difference between the warm brown of her skin and the deep black of her hair held her in rapt attention.

"I'm so glad you're up on your feet and I don't need to take you to the hospital." The lady's calm voice broke the spell their face had cast on her. "I was really worried with how cold you got last night. You got a name Trouble? I can't keep calling you that forever." 

Felicity didn't answer, she was enjoying listing to the delightful sound of this woman's voice and wondering if she had her ID in her wallet and if her wallet had gone through the wash with her clothes.

"Hey Trouble, you with me?" The lady snapped her fingers and lent down a little to get on her level. Felicity realized she was staring and also not listening to what was being said. She broke eye contact and looked down to find her feet, she could see the hint of the black that running around in the rain had painted the soles of her feet.

"Sorry, I don't mean to be a bother..." She mumbled, scrambling to remember anything that had just been said and focus back on the present.

Her efforts were thwarted when the taller lady gripped her chin and bid her to meet her gaze once more. As Felicity yielded to her silent demand, the other lady returned to their full height and began inspecting her face. With nowhere to look but at her captor, Felicity felt her face flush warm.

"You're not in trouble, Trouble. And you're not in danger here." Her inspector said she she continued investigating her face as though counting all her bruises. "We can keep you safe here, we've got a shelter program at this hotel. We keep a few rooms open for when there's people who... look like they've had a fight with a flight of stairs." The inspection moved on to her arms which she snatched back and tried to cover, but since she was wearing a sleeveless shirt not much was achieved besides Felicity feeling the hairs on her arms stand on end from the attention.

Felicity took a step back, feeling boxed in in the small room. The tall lady stood between her and the door, and while it didn't seem like she was trying to block the way, it would be hard to get around her in a room this small without them having a good chance to grab or stop Felicity.

"Do you want some food? You look like you need some food." The lady continued undeterred. 

"I'm fine." Felicity lied.

"I'm gonna sort a room out for you and bring you something to eat. Warm food will help, just wait here for a moment." Her final words being emphasized with her pointing to the chair in the corner.

The door closed again, and Felicity was left alone with her thoughts.

She felt conflicted. 

Was she actually safe?

Was this some kind of elaborate rouse?

Was that lady's hair heavy?

Did her wallet go through a wash cycle?

What kind of Hotel had rooms that looked this scammy and prison like?

Not confident to test if the door opened from this side, Felicity sat in the chair as directed. Her head in her hands. And did her best not to panic.

***

Her thoughts spun like cogs in a machine. Brun found herself plotting the most efficient route to do everything she'd just volunteered to do.

Since the shortest route used the staff room behind the reception to reach the kitchen, the reception was her first destination. Closing the door to the nap room behind her and looking around to see if there were any guests in the corridor.

Brun broke character from her work persona and started to walk at full speed. She had been told some time ago that guests had found her striding purposefully around the building to be intimidating. So she had taken up the habit of walking as silently and unnoticeable as possible, taking tips from her coworker Dee, who had such an eclectic collection of skills and talents it wouldn't be a surprise to learn they had a side-gig as a part-time ninja.

Having actually met Trouble now, she was confident they were someone who needed help and she was someone who could give it. Brun stopped in her tracks and snapped her fingers.

"Did I forgot to ask what her name was? Did I forget after asking?" Brun asked no one in particular. "Well...now I know what pseudonym to book her room under." And took off again towards the reception.

Moment's later she arrived at the reception, and dialed Manager Beth's after hours number, reading it from the well worn note stuck to the staff side of the reception desk. And to her credit, despite it being five AM, she picked up after three rings.

"Do I want to know what's wrong?" Beth's voice asked through the phone.

"Nothing's wrong. Just had an expected arrival." Brun started typing in the reception computer to start the check in process.

"Who arrives at...gah! Five in the morning, that's a terrible time to turn up, and in this weather too." Brun could hear Beth fighting her bedding while looking for her glasses, smiling with the newfound knowledge that she misplaced them at home as much as at work.

"They actually arrived last night. They're a sanctuary case, that's why I called."

"Ohh, they seem sane and in need?" Beth asked, the sounds of her struggling on the other end stopped.

"Covered in defensive looking bruises, they looked like they were planning to escape when I spoke to them just now, doesn't look like they've ever eaten a full meal. Yeah, I think they're in need."

"What name are we checking them in under?" Beth had switched fully to her serious voice now.

"Trouble." Brun said, feeling less sure of her decision than she had been moments earlier.

"No, Love. Don't call her that to her face. That's going to be funny when we 'look for Trouble' in the system later, but she's probably having a real time of it." Beth's serious voice hadn't survived the joke and she had immediately fallen back into her casual chatting voice customers never got to hear.

"No promises." Brun said with a smile as she noted the room number the computer spat out for Trouble's room and grabbed the corresponding key.

"OK, I'll send a mass text to everyone so they know to play dumb if anyone comes by asking vague questions. Is it still raining? Gah, listen to it come down out there. I don't envy Trouble for having to travel out in this weather." Beth sounded like she was getting back into bed on the other end of the line. "Maybe I won't come by the office after all. OK, you're in charge Brunhilde, talk later." And Beth ended the call.

Brun put the phone back on the receiver, and strode into the backroom paths that lead to the kitchen.

Minutes later, with a hastily assembled plate of fried foods, plus a single ripe avocado that kept trying to roll off the plate, Brun approached the nap room door and hoped Trouble was still waiting for her beyond it.

Opening the door, she found Trouble sitting, and living up to their newly assigned moniker, looking troubled. They didn't seem to react to the door opening, so Brun placed the plate on the cot and got down into a squat to get on the same eye level again.

"Hey..." Brun caught herself in time and wracked her mind for any other name to use aside from Trouble. "Small One." She didn't think this was much better than Trouble, but this was no time to show hesitation. Once more she gently gripped the only part of Trouble's face that wasn't covered in bruises, their chin, and tried to encourage them to look up. "Things are going to be okay now, yeah?"

Brun assumed she was unconvincing, due to how as soon as she got Trouble to look her in the eyes tears welled up and they looked like they were on the verge of crying. Looking closer, she realized they must have been crying a lot while she was gone, and Trouble's eyes were a lot more puffy and swollen than when she had left. She tried to change tactics, and since she didn't think the dingy nap room's prison aesthetic were helping, did some quick maths on how to get both of them and the food out of the nap room in the most efficient way.

"Are you up for a quick walk? I've got something to show you." Brun entirely gave up trying to read Trouble's expression and did her best to power through and lead her out of the cell-like room. Moving her hand from Trouble's chin to hand and grabbing the plate of food in her other she tried to have both of them stand up together and lead them out into the hallway. 

As they walked the hallways to Trouble's room, Brun recognized in Trouble the habit of purposefully quiet footsteps she used for work. Their form wasn't the precise and purposeful one that Brun had practiced, but it did speak more of her circumstances than Trouble had said aloud so far.

Looking ahead again and realizing they were still ten doors away from the room, Brun found herself focusing on Trouble's hand in hers. Their long delicate fingers felt soft in her hand, except for a rough patch that presumably was a graze she could feel near the heel of their palm. Her brow furrowed in anger. Brun didn't know why she felt this strongly about someone she didn't know having signs of injury, she considered her own attention hard to win. Did she see Trouble as akin to an animal? Small and harmless? Or did she feel safe because they didn't talk much? Did that say something about her? Only liking someone who said nothing back? Like some sort of voyeur?

Brun wrestled her mind out of her own self obsessive thoughts and counted the steps out as they arrived at the room.

"Three, two, one, this door. We've given you suite seventeen." Brun announced, hip checking the security pad with her master key to momentarily unlock it. And when Trouble made no moves to open the door and Brun still had no free hands, she lost her cool. Kicking out and delicately swiping the door handle down with her foot while at the same time pushing it open in the brief window where it could move before the lock re-armed. Brun pulled herself together again while silently reprimanding herself for the violence and trying to not congratulate herself on the successful trick.

She lead Trouble into the room, pointing out the bathroom and kitchenette, placing the food down on the counter in the latter, before leading them to the bed. The bed was enormous, part of why this room was set aside for use in sanctuary cases was very few guests ever asked for the room with the bed that could easily fit three people side by side. Trouble still looked exhausted on top of injured, even if Brun had just taken them out of a room with a bed, they still looked like they needed more rest. Even if they'd just been sleeping and resting they looked like they needed another whole week's worth of rest. Fetching her, now cooling, plate of food Brun tried to get Trouble's attention again.

"I cooked you some warm food, just like a said I would." Giving the plate a gentle rap with the back of her nails to draw Trouble's attention while holding out a fork for them. "Warm food to warm your soul?"

Watching Trouble eating gave Brun the exact type of emotion she was expecting, but she didn't like it. It seemed she very much did equate Trouble with a small creature in need of help, because she felt the same watching Trouble eat as she did when birds or critters got to the food she might set out of them from the kitchen scraps. She looked away, lay on the bed beside Trouble, and began scolding herself.

"Hey..." Brun tried to talk to dismiss her own train of thought before Manager Beth's warning not to use trouble as a name floated to fill the space. "...Small One..." Brun used every ounce of mental fortitude to not slap herself for further infantilizing her ward. Trouble was a better name than that, and using Small One twice was an utter failure on her part. She forced herself to keep talking so that wasn't how that sentence ended. "I'm going to keep you safe." She tried to reassure Trouble, but with her multitude of fuck ups, simple platitudes didn't seem like enough, especially since they hadn't even paused eating in response.

"Actually safe, I'm the only person who knows you came here, and we've checked you in under a pseudonym so no one can ask after you." Brun then realized this might sound like she had planned the perfect kidnapping and her internal count of crimes and failures increased once more. "My shift's over in ten minutes so I'm fine to just sit with you and do whatever you need to feel content. I'll stay by your side until you feel safe." As the words tumbled out of her mouth Brun realized she actually meant it, this was put on her mental pile of stuff to consider later. She took the room key from her pocket and placed it on Trouble's thigh.

"Ohh, by the way I'm Brunhilde. You can just call me Brun." Brun interjected once more into the silence. Realizing while she still didn't know Trouble's name, they also didn't know hers. She was curious if Trouble had given her a name as she had for them, but held the question back.

Trouble said something, but it was too quiet for Brun to hear. She sat up and shuffled closer to her and leaned in.

"Pardon, Love, I didn't catch that."

"Felicity" Trouble muttered. Brun, having been awake for eighteen hours at this point and just finished a nine hour graveyard shift, took a moment to connect the dots. Brun furrowed her brow, and tried as hard as she could to overwrite where she had stored Trouble's name to replace it with Felicity.

"Lovely to hear, Felicity." Brun announced, doing her darnedest to not think the world trouble.

As silence settled back over the room, broken only by Felicity's quiet eating, Brun lay back on the bed, making sure to keep either an arm or leg touching her ward in an effort to reassure them.
