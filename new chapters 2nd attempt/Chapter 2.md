Her sleep was deep and dreamless. She almost didn't notice she had woken up as there was almost no ambient noise.

Felicity lurched into a seated position, reaching for her bedside table to brace against, a pounding headache and general body ache assailing her as her all at once to let her know that moving was a bad idea. Leaning on the bedside table was also a bad idea because it wasn't there, this wasn't her bedroom.

She cursed as she fell to the ground on thin carpet. Carpet she'd never seen before. 

Where was she?

How did she get here?

The last she remembered...

She had fled.

It had rained.

It had really rained.

She'd been buffeted by the winds and knocked onto the road.

And had tried to reach...

Her head whipped around to find a very small room, about the size she expected a cell to be, with barely any furnishings. A mirror, the bed she'd fallen out of, a closed door, a chair that had her clothes folded up on, a desk phone not living up to it's name on the floor, and herself on the floor tangled in several cotton blankets.

She took a double take at her clothes on the chair and realized she wasn't wearing any clothes. Someone had stripped her while she slept, a sickening feeling of violation crept over her. Frank's stories about his police friends and them functionally abducting women out of shelters came to mind.

Knowing she would be better prepared for what came next by actually wearing her clothes, so she grabbed her pants an jammed her legs into them. Followed by grabbing her shirt.

She took a moment to pause, as her senses slowly told her something nice had happened. Her legs were wrapped in a glorious warmth she'd not known for years. Her clothes felt like they'd just come out of the tumble dryer, or had sat to warm in front of a fire. They were wonderfully toasty and soft. Except her butt, as she noticed her underwear was still damp.

Felicity heard the door she had yet to investigate open, and quick as a flash held her shirt up to cover her petite chest and modesty while staying facing away from it.

"Morning Trouble, I'm glad to see you up on your feet after last night. Let me get a look at you." A voice she didn't know spoke behind her. Felicity checked to see if the mirror showed who had come in, but it pointed the wrong way. Before she think further, rough, work-worn hands gripped her shoulders and bid her to turn around and she prepared to defend herself.

Turned around, Felicity found herself staring at the clavicle and neck of a dark skinned woman. Looking up, she found herself staring harder at the face of that woman. A warm smile, kind eyes, and a single braid that had escaped the bun of them atop her head. The stark difference between the warm brown of her skin and the deep black of her hair held her in rapt attention.

"I'm so glad you're up on your feet and I don't need to take you to the hospital." The lady's calm voice broke the spell her face had cast on her. "I was really worried with how cold you got last night. You got a name Trouble? I can't keep calling you that forever." 

Felicity didn't answer, she was enjoying listing to the delightful rasp of this woman's voice and wondering if she had her ID in her wallet and if her wallet had gone through the wash with her clothes.

"Hey Trouble, you with me?" The lady snapped her fingers and lent down a little to get on her level. Felicity realized she was staring and also not listening to what was being said. She broke eye contact and looked down to find her feet, she could see the hint of how black walking around in the rain had painted the soles of her feet.

"Sorry, I don't mean to be a bother..." She mumbled, scrambling to remember anything that had just been said and focus back on the present.

Her efforts were thwarted when the taller lady gripped her chin and bid her to meet her gaze once more. As Felicity yeilded to her silent demand, the other lady returned to their full height and began inspecting her face. With nowhere to look but at her captor, Felicity felt her face flush warm.

"You're not in trouble, Trouble." Her inspector said she she continued investigating her face as though counting all her bruises. "We can keep you safe here, we've got a shelter program. We keep an open few
