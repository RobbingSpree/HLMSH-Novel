Trouble felt oddly driven. While things were still not going well, she was actually taking steps to face it.

Her life had felt like it was at the beck and call of anyone who could wield power over her, her parents, then boss, then boyfriend. Each time, she had just gone with it because when she tried to take control of her own life things went aggressively wrong. Having her stuff stolen, or broken, or sometimes it turned violent. Complying was always the safest course.

She thought back to how Debug and Beth had seen her off from the reception while Brun was finishing up. Debug had pulled her aside and had walked her through what to expect and how to act natural. While Debug had been walking her through the steps and pulling out IDs to use as examples Beth had been standing on a box behind them and peering over their shoulder with a look of utter disbelief. 

It had been a struggle to keep a straight face while Beth was being odd and while Debug spoke in a serious authoritative tone, her gruff and low voice. The things she mentioned to look out for were all early signs things were going poorly. Which she recognized as the same sort of things she had used to try and manage Frank's emotions to prevent him from blowing up at her.

Debug had been very analytical, but had said it all so confidently that it made it seem like their whole scheme was going to go without a hitch.

Trouble turned to look at Brunhilde, a thing she had been doing a lot on the bus ride to the hospital, and noticed a hitch.

"But what's your name?" The half formed idea managed to beat the compliment she would have been very embarrassed to say apropos of nothing. Brun stopped looking out the window and looked down at her.

"Trouble? My name's Brunhilde? Are you ok?" They reached out a hand to do the same thing that had been giving her a fuzzy mind all morning and gently caress her cheek. Trouble fought the instinct to let the gentle touch happen, to revel in the warm hand of her knight. Instead, she pushed Brunhilde's hand away with their own wallet Trouble had been holding.

"If I'm using your name while we're at the hospital, which name are you going to use? We can't both be Brunhilde." Trouble tried to bark at herself in her own mind, anything to keep herself focused on the task at hand and not fantasizing about Brun's gentle caress. 

"Hmm, good point. What would you call me?"

"Princess." Trouble's mouth said before she could stop it.

"Ohh?" Brun raised an eyebrow as a smile crept over her lips. "Now I'm curious, what lead you to that idea? I'm not going to say no, by the way. I already gave you a cover name, seems fair you give me one back."

Trouble wracked her mind and engaged her creative prowess of making stuff up, normally reserved for unhelpful clients who asked too many questions about the creative process.

"You've got a bit of a regal air to you, like a confidence to lead and a duty to protect." She lied, unaware if her blush could be seen through her bruising. 

"Oh really? Well, then from one Brunhilde to another also remember to learn my surname. Last time I came to the hospital it was all they called me by, I think the nurse didn't have the confidence to guess how to pronounce my first name." 

"What's your surname?" Trouble asked, while opening Brun's wallet and finding out herself. "Brown?!" She looked up at Brun's face for guidance. She had a wry smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. Doubtless people had made snide comments about her name and skin colour being a fitting match.

"A bit on the nose, eh?" Trouble's heart ached for her knight and the sadness in their voice. "It'll be a nice change of pace when I get married one day and can take someone else's."

"We could change it sooner." Trouble spoke before the thought occurred to her. "Debug doesn't sound like a name someone's parents would pick. You can be like her and just change it."

"To Princess?" Brun teased, with a smile that player across her whole face. 

"Probably not Princess. But names are funny things, they can fit you, and then you change and they're suddenly a call back to who you used to be or who someone wished you would be." Trouble broke eye contact and fiddled with Brun's wallet. "When I was talking to Debug earlier and I got my ID out I was confused. I saw Felicity on my ID and thought there was a mistake." She took an unsteady and purposeful breath to calm herself before continuing. "I honestly forgot that was my name. The last few days have been such a whirlwind I was expecting to read Trouble on my ID instead."

Brun wrapped their arm around her and made agreeing noises.

"Well if it becomes safe to spend the day at the local government office we'll make a day of changing your name to Trouble. And by the time that comes, I hope you find me a more fitting name too."

Trouble relaxed into Brun's embrace and did her best to calm herself as the bus lurched and trundled onward.

***

Debug had made her metaphorical bed, and now she was doing her best to not lay in it.

Beth had been all but harassing her all shift. Since they had been reminded of their bet, it was a constant thing now. 

Beth would leave the reception area, head out to the rest of the building and do the day tasks, and make excuses to swing past the reception desk and pester Debug again and again. And they were quite aware that they were low on guesses and had no leads, and with how Debug had been pushing them to drop it, it was clear they had probably until the end of the shift when it would cross the line into actual harrassment. 

Currently, Debug was enjoying a moment of peace. An annoying guest had just checked out and she didn't have anyone scheduled to check in for the afternoon. She was planning to get back to one of the longer term projects to keep her hands busy when something caught her attention.

The front door of the hotel closed automatically. But no one had approached either from inside or out. 

Debug pulled up the security cameras to see if there was a cat or something Brun had lured near causing it to see activity. The security camera was set up right next to the door sensor and was the only thing that could definitely show that was causing the door to imagine a person.

She saw nothing on the screen at all, no movement, nothing alive at all. But then the doors lurched open again, and a second later once the video feed delay caught up the camera feed flashed pure white. Like somehow it was pointed at the sun or something. 

Debug's fight or fight harder instincts kicked in and she pulled up the street view security cameras instead. After a quick scan she found the offending vehicle. She knew this trick. Shine a laser pointer at a door sensor and overwhelm it, it would open and allow someone much further away to look inside the building without being seen. It was something privet eyes and stalkers did. And with no one having come or gone from the reception in the last several minutes she could only suspect they were getting details of staff to harass later.

Debug found the desk phone already in her hand as she checked for the note she had written years ago of the emergency contact details for Beth.

She wanted to think this was to do with Trouble. But nothing could put out the smouldering fear of her own past. Her litany of abusers and criminals who had a self righteous grudge were a constant concern. 

The Beth answered the call after a half dozen rings.

"Can I make another guess?" Beth's voice was still as cheerful as it had been twenty minutes ago.

"I need you to go across the street with your phone and take a photo." Debug felt every part of her body flexing and straining as she fought to remain calm, her voice sounded monotone and robotic.

"It's serious...okay, want me to pop out a window so I don't get seen?" Beth caught on something was up, but Debug wasn't sure how to describe the situation. Their bet still playing on her mind, if she said the wrong thing or was too detailed Beth might catch on to her experience and push her to talk more. She didn't want to be too vague and miss the chance to get a clean picture of who was in the car. If she had a record of who it was she could use that to get a start on a stalking charge or restraining order, even if it turned out not to be someone looking for her. 

"Be quick either way, I don't know how long we have." Debug's voice sounded foreign to her own ears.

"Okay, just sneaking through the cafe's bar garden next door." Beth updated.

Moments passed, all debug could hear through the phone was thee sound of clothes moving and Beth's heavy breathing from running.

She stared at the car in the security camera, tabbing through all the other feeds to see if any other camera showed more of the street or a different angle of the car.

"Okay, I'm directly across the street. What am I taking a photo of?" Beth's voice returned, breaking Debug's concentration.

"Blue ute, has a two by four in the back. The driver or front passenger seat should have some wanker pointing a camera or binoculars or a laser pointer at the front door." Debug paused for a second when Beth's breathing stopped being loud enough for the phone to pick up. She was likely using the camera function to do their own spying. When the sound of their breathing came back she continued. "We need as clear a photo of them without digital zoom as you can get, not higher than three times zoom probably."

The silence as Beth did hopefully a good enough job was agony. The fact she couldn't go out there herself, or provide more context on how to take a good photo, or trust Beth to do what she needed. It all ate at her. A lack of an ability to directly fight. 

Debug was confident she couldn't be seen very well from the car's currently vantage point, the lighting in the reception was always terrible for seeing who was at the desk. But if she moved, turned too far to either side, that would change. She needed to provide as useless a shiluette as possible, and not act in such a way as to spook the stalker before Beth reported success.

The seconds stretched on, painfully. Having a staring contest with someone she couldn't see, with intentions she didn't know, on half a nap, of a shift she wasn't supposed to be on. She was going to relapse and start cutting if this kept up for the rest of the shift.

Beth's voice returned and Debug tried to shelve the tempting thoughts of drowning anxiety with endorphins for later.

"Ok, I got like eight good ones, they look like a right fuckwad." Debug was thrown entirely off her depressive funk with Beth's put of character language.

"Did you get that from one of your books? I've never heard you talk like that." Debug's legs felt weak, her voice sounded normal, she became very worried she was going to move too much and be seen well enough to ID and later stalk, the urge to cry flooded her mind. With the tension gone, all that was left holding her up was desk and her boots that were too tight around her ankles.

"Can I come back in at least? I don't think the cafe will let me back through at this hour."

Debug didn't have anything left in her for talking. She reached over to the big panel of switches the controlled the exterior lights. Most of them were used for seasonal events, but one was for when they'd rented the carpark to a coalition of cafes and pubs nearby to have a small Thursday night beer fest. Flicking the switch on caused the floodlights to start building a charge, giving the front facade of the hotel and ominous orange glow.

"Dee, what are you doing? What's that?" Beth's confusion hopefully mirroring the stalker.

The flood lights made dramatic thunks as they finally got enough power to turn on, and the whole car park and section of road in front of the hotel was flooded with light. Dramatic shadows clung to the ground behind anything taller than a garden bed. All the security camera feeds went completely blank as they struggled to keep you with the ambient light change.

Unable to see anything now, Debug was left to listen to the chaos outside as drivers failed to understand what was going on. A crowd of pedestrians and pub goers gathered at the edges of where the light spilled onto the road and pavement. Several people swore loudly at the light, someone threw a bottle well short of the hotel, and the obnoxious engine of a presumably blue ute roared to life and made to drive off.
