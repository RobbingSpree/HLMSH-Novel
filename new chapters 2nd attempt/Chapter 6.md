Trouble felt oddly driven. While things were still not going well, she was actually taking steps to face it.

Her life had felt like it was at the beck and call of anyone who could wield power over her, her parents, then boss, then boyfriend. Each time, she had just gone with it because when she tried to take control of her own life things went aggressively wrong. Having her stuff stolen, or broken, or sometimes it turned violent. Complying was always the safest course.

She thought back to how Debug and Beth had seen her off from the reception while Brun was finishing up. Debug had pulled her aside and had walked her through what to expect and how to act natural. While Debug had been walking her through the steps and pulling out IDs to use as examples Beth had been standing on a box behind them and peering over their shoulder with a look of utter disbelief. 

It had been a struggle to keep a straight face while Beth was being odd and while Debug spoke in a serious authoritative tone, her gruff and low voice. The things she mentioned to look out for were all early signs things were going poorly. Which she recognized as the same sort of things she had used to try and manage Frank's emotions to prevent him from blowing up at her.

Debug had been very analytical, but had said it all so confidently that it made it seem like their whole scheme was going to go without a hitch.

Trouble turned to look at Brunhilde, a thing she had been doing a lot on the bus ride to the hospital, and noticed a hitch.

"But what's your name?" The half formed idea managed to beat the compliment she would have been very embarrassed to say apropos of nothing. Brun stopped looking out the window and looked down at her.

"Trouble? My name's Brunhilde? Are you ok?" They reached out a hand to do the same thing that had been giving her a fuzzy mind all morning and gently caress her cheek. Trouble fought the instinct to let the gentle touch happen, to revel in the warm hand of her knight. Instead, she pushed Brunhilde's hand away with their own wallet Trouble had been holding.

"If I'm using your name while we're at the hospital, which name are you going to use? We can't both be Brunhilde." Trouble tried to bark at herself in her own mind, anything to keep herself focused on the task at hand and not fantasizing about Brun's gentle caress. 

"Hmm, good point. What would you call me?"

"Princess." Trouble's mouth said before she could stop it.

"Ohh?" Brun raised an eyebrow as a smile crept over her lips. "Now I'm curious, what lead you to that idea? I'm not going to say no, by the way. I already gave you a cover name, seems fair you give me one back."

Trouble wracked her mind and engaged her creative prowess of making stuff up, normally reserved for unhelpful clients who asked too many questions about the creative process.

"You've got a bit of a regal air to you, like a confidence to lead and a duty to protect." She lied, unaware if her blush could be seen through her bruising. 

"Oh really? Well, then from one Brunhilde to another also remember to learn my surname. Last time I came to the hospital it was all they called me by, I think the nurse didn't have the confidence to guess how to pronounce my first name." 

"What's your surname?" Trouble asked, while opening Brun's wallet and finding out herself. "Brown?!" She looked up at Brun's face for guidance. She had a wry smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. Doubtless people had made snide comments about her name and skin colour being a fitting match.

"A bit on the nose, eh?" Trouble's heart ached for her knight and the sadness in their voice. "It'll be a nice change of pace when I get married one day and can take someone else's."

"We could change it sooner." Trouble spoke before the thought occured to her. "Debug doesn't sound like a name someone's parents would pick. You can be like her and just change it."

"To Princess?" Brun teased, with a smile that player across her whole face.
