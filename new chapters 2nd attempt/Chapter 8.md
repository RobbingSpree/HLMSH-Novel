She still felt disconnected from her body and emotions, robotically answering their questions on how to reach her prison.

The seatbelt felt tight and rough through her shirt, the rhythm of the road and the frequent speed bumps attacking her through the seat. 

Brunhilde's reassuring hand on hers while they drove. 

The commissioner's voice from the driver's seat asking question after question in that same commanding voice that kept telling her things were under control.

"And their car? Do they have one? Do they park it on the street?"

She answered.

"Got it." The commissioner replied. "We'll pull up and scout the place, if we see things we don't like we'll leave. Since you left on foot, no one will think you're returning via car, you'll be safe to sit in here while we work." Their gruff voice barking with absolute confidence. 

"Trouble, what do you absolutely need?" The knight asked her.

"You said she was talking about work before she got upset, so work stuff, spare clothes, shoes, legal documents, phone which we'll turn off before we leave. That's kinda it for a go bag. Do you know what she does for a job?"

"Digital art. But I don't know what you even use to do digital art, have you tried drawing with a mouse? It's impossible to draw a straight line." As the casual conversation continued, she felt more and more real. Like things that were happening were happening to her.

"Okay, look sharp!" The commissioner announced. "This is the street. We're looking for an obnoxiously tall ute. Should stick out like a sore thumb in a tight street like this."

"I don't see anything, just normal sedans and the one mom van."

"I never knew what a sedan meant, is it just the generic looking car?" Debug's confident voice changing to much more casual.

"Number 17, same as your room at the hotel." Brunhilde squeezed her hand as they pointed to the blue door she had been trapped behind until recently.

"Okay furtive criminals!" Debug barked.

"Furtive? Have you been reading Beth's stories?"

"Shut it, eyes on me and focus. Crimes are serious business, and while this technically isn't a crime cause you live here Cuddlepot and asked me to do this. We don't want to look suspicious and get the cops called on us." Debug turned in their seat to face the pair in the back. "I'll head over, pick the lock, open the door, then signal you two to come over. Then we grab everything on our list and bolt back to the car. Trouble, you stay somewhere central so we can find and ask you were to find something ASAP." Trouble had to wonder just how many times Debug had been forced to do this sort of thing before to have this sensible a plan at the drop of a hat.

Barely waiting for her response, Debug lept out of the car and strode across the quiet street to that blue door. 

The street felt unnaturally quiet, but for someone who had been a homebody for the last few years, she didn't know how the street naturally looked at this time of day. She was normally asleep. Frank had barely been staying at her house before she'd escaped, and for his own debt problems he couldn't afford to skip work. So with no sign of his car they were safe from him for now.

Trouble couldn't see what Trouble was up to, but in what seemed like no time she had the front door open and was beckoning for everyone else to follow.

Once out of the car, Brun hurried around to her side and helped lead her over the road. While it might have been a bit dramatic, she had tried to collapse earlier, so she understood the caution.

Her home and prison looked cold and empty, all the lights off and the early morning light creeping up its walls. Debug was standing in the doorway with a handful of blue stuff.

"Disposable gloves, you said he had police contacts so I found these under your bathroom sink. Let's not give them anything." They held their hand full of gloves out.

Trouble could sense how well Brun and Trouble worked together, they never stood too close to the other or got in one another's way as they essentially danced around a house they'd never been in before. She felt a twinge of jealousy
