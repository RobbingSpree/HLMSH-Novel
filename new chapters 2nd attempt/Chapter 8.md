She still felt disconnected from her body and emotions, robotically answering their questions on how to reach her prison.

The seatbelt felt tight and rough through her shirt, the rhythm of the road and the frequent speed bumps attacking her through the seat. 

Brunhilde's reassuring hand on hers while they drove. 

The commissioner's voice from the driver's seat asking question after question in that same commanding voice that kept telling her things were under control.

"And their car? Do they have one? Do they park it on the street?"

She answered.

"Got it." The commissioner replied. "We'll pull up and scout the place, if we see things we don't like we'll leave. Since you left on foot, no one will think you're returning via car, you'll be safe to sit in here while we work." Their gruff voice barking with absolute confidence. 

"Trouble, what do you absolutely need?" The knight asked her.

"You said she was talking about work before she got upset, so work stuff, spare clothes, shoes, legal documents, phone which we'll turn off before we leave. That's kinda it for a go bag. Do you know what she does for a job?"

"Digital art. But I don't know what you even use to do digital art, have you tried drawing with a mouse? It's impossible to draw a straight line." As the casual conversation continued, she felt more and more real. Like things that were happening were happening to her.

"Okay, look sharp!" The commissioner announced. "This is the street. We're looking for an obnoxiously tall ute. Should stick out like a sore thumb in a tight street like this."

"I don't see anything, just normal sedans and the one mom van."

"I never knew what a sedan meant, is it just the generic looking car?" Debug's confident voice changing to much more casual.

"Number 17, same as your room at the hotel." Brunhilde squeezed her hand as they pointed to the blue door she had been trapped behind until recently.

"Okay furtive criminals!" Debug barked.

"Furtive? Have you been reading Beth's stories?"

"Shut it, eyes on me and focus. Crimes are serious business, and while this technically isn't a crime cause you live here Cuddlepot and asked me to do this. We don't want to look suspicious and get the cops called on us." Debug turned in their seat to face the pair in the back. "I'll head over, pick the lock, open the door, then signal you two to come over. Then we grab everything on our list and bolt back to the car. Trouble, you stay somewhere central so we can find and ask you were to find something ASAP." Trouble had to wonder just how many times Debug had been forced to do this sort of thing before to have this sensible a plan at the drop of a hat.

Barely waiting for her response, Debug lept out of the car and strode across the quiet street to that blue door. 

The street felt unnaturally quiet, but for someone who had been a homebody for the last few years, she didn't know how the street naturally looked at this time of day. She was normally asleep. Frank had barely been staying at her house before she'd escaped, and for his own debt problems he couldn't afford to skip work. So with no sign of his car they were safe from him for now.

Trouble couldn't see what Trouble was up to, but in what seemed like no time she had the front door open and was beckoning for everyone else to follow.

Once out of the car, Brun hurried around to her side and helped lead her over the road. While it might have been a bit dramatic, she had tried to collapse earlier, so she understood the caution.

Her home and prison looked cold and empty, all the lights off and the early morning light creeping up its walls. Debug was standing in the doorway with a handful of blue stuff.

"Disposable gloves, you said he had police contacts so I found these under your bathroom sink. Let's not give them anything." They held their hand full of gloves out.

Trouble could sense how well Brun and Trouble worked together, they never stood too close to the other or got in one another's way as they essentially danced around a house they'd never been in before. She felt a twinge of jealousy of how in sync the two were, she had never had that with anyone before, if she excluded Frank and her Dad where she made herself as small as possible in their presence so they'd never notice her.

"Check the bedroom for bras and underwater, grab three of both."

"Got it. Take over on the computer stuff, I don't know which cables this needs to work."

"Trouble, tell Brun where your serious business documents are, like lease, bills and birth cert."

"Dee, how do you turn off a phone like this? Long pressing isn't working."

"Ohh, a classic. Long press the red button under the screen. The side buttons are for media playback only on something that old."

"Ok we've got everything we need, grab one or two other garments for outerwear from your wardrobe and we'll jam everything in the car so we all fit in the drive back. Bee, let's go."

Suddenly, the house was silent again. 

With her friends gone, it was as though they took all power and intimidation the building used to hold over her with them to pack into the car.

This was just a house now.

One she didn't have to come back to if she didn't want to.

Like a weight she had been dragging had been cut free.

She walked into the bedroom, took her two most comfortable shirts from her small wardrobe, and bid the building farewell.

***

Brun felt uncomfortable driving the unfamiliar car, her day had been surprisingly long and she was thinking only of sleep.

"Dee, you awake back there? Gonna need your help to do one load of carrying each to get all this stuff out."

"I'm awake, but Trouble seems to have succumbed to the siren's call of sleep. So we both have to carry a bit more."

Brun paused for a moment, taking in the streets and the cramped close rows of houses before she turned onto the main road.

"Nah. She's got a broken arm remember, I wasn't planning she carry anything. One last job for the two of us."

"Before Beth seperates us for good, you mean?"

"I didn't mean that..." She could hear Dee being bitter about the news. "We can always hang out outside of work, you know. We don't have to be just work friends." She had tried in the past to get Debug to spend time with her outside the riding structure and responsibilities of their jobs, but had gotten incredibly sick that whole week instead. Dee hadn't believed her excuses and she was nothing if not a solid example of the saying 'once bitten twice shy'. 

"Being on opposite shifts doesn't help. I looked forward to any time I had a shift following yours so I could enjoy the handover window with you. It was the highlights of my week." Debug was being a lot more forthcoming with conversation than they normally were, maybe this was how they were when tired. "Trouble really is out of it back here...are we just gonna let her sleep...is she asleep?"

"When I looked in the mirror before she looked like she dozed off right after we started driving. Poor thing, she's had a big few days, and she still has work in the morning."

"Who works Monday's?" Debug sounded genuinely confused.

"Bug, not everyone works shifts, some people did nine to five work days."

"Right, but that's adults. Businessmen and lawyers, do that."

"Bug...I hate to say it...but we're adults. We're the ones with a job and career prospects and bills."

"Ohh." Bee's voice was very quiet, like she had honestly not thought about this before. "Never thought I'd be an adult..." Brun didn't know what that meant, but also didn't want to say anything stupid to upset them. So instead tried to divert the conversation to her next step.

"I'm tired as fuck, and I don't want to have to go home just to get a solid nap in, and my sleep schedule is already shot to hell." She could probably justify her idea more, but it would feel like making excuses after any more. "I'm gonna sleep in Trouble's room, just have a casual sleep over. I asked her on the drive to her place and it was one of the few questions she answered clearly."

"Are you bragging right now?" Debug's voice had its normal hint of cheekyness again.

"No, I know the size of bed in Trouble's suite. We can all fit on the bed. All three of us." There was a moment of silence and the sound of the car on the road. "That includes you, Bee. Join the sleep over. You look just as tired as I feel."

Debug's mind was racing like a three legged mutt at the greyhound race.

She kept swinging back and forth that she'd said too much or been too abrasive in the car ride, that she should have turned Brun down. But at the same time, she had been wrong about how much energy she had left, and was barely hanging on.

Bee had clearly spotted this, and rather than help make what they had described as 'a nest' she had been sent down to get Trouble from the car and bring her up. And it was unclear if this was a punishment of not, as she was actively trying to fall asleep on the walk through the hotel. The on shift morning staff had been rather concerned when they saw her in the halls.

Since she couldn't turn back time, she'd just have to live with whatever she said and make excuses later.

She reached the car, and opened Trouble's door to find them still dozing and covered in bandages. This poor thing really did need someone looking out for them, and while Brun was a great emotional bulwark who made people feel safe, they might need someone who had survived similar circumstances. The problem would be she would have to admit to having PTSD and being honest with someone, but she hadn't been liking how Manager Beth had been cornering her on that lately, so if she practiced with Trouble she might get the confidence to emotionally dump on Beth as revenge for their prying.

"Hey Snugglebunny, wake up. Let's go somewhere more comfortable so you can get proper sleep." She jostled Trouble, leaving over them and unbuckling their seatbelt. She was still quite close to their face when they did stir. "Morning." Their face flushed with an emotion Debug didn't recognize, but she just assumed she wasn't going to have any smart thoughts while being this tired so put it from her mind.

"We got home safe?" They asked, still bleary eyed.

"Yep, I had Brun drive cause I was close to a nap like you were." Lightly pulling on their sleeve to remind them they needed to get out of the car. "Let's put you to bed first."

Trouble stumbled out of the car, drew themselves to their full height, slouched again and trudged towards the door. Debug took a few quick steps to catch up and trudged alongside them.

The reception was empty as they reached the building, Debug's todo list pulled at her mind. She needed to ask about the guy Beth had taken a photo of.

"Actually, Cutie..." Debug had no idea how Brun or Beth made making pet names up on the spot look east. "I've got something on the reception computer to ask you about, join me back here." As she lead Trouble into the employees only area.

With practiced ease she logged into the computer and navigated to where she'd put the photos and opened them.

"So this guy turned up earlier today looking very suspicious..." She started as she turned to talk to Trouble rather than at the screen. "...fuck."

Trouble had already started to hyperventilate and panic. The few patches of their face that wasn't covered in bandages and bruises was deadly pale. She was vindicated in her suspicions, but this was probably not the best time or way to talk about this. Mashing keys on the computer to close the picture with one hand and trying to hold Trouble up and failing with the other, they ended up on the floor in a pile.

It had been a long time since she was responsible for someone this upset. Using what strength she had, she managed to turn the sobbing Trouble around to face her, then shuffled as close to her as possible. Close enough that they sat with hips side by side, Debug using her body to help keep Trouble from leaning so far that they collapsed entirely onto the ground.

She put a hand on their head and gently bonked their foreheads together, aiming to try and bring their focus as close and as small as possible. 

"Breath okay?" She placed a hand on their chest as they took their first deep shaky breath for nearly a minute.
