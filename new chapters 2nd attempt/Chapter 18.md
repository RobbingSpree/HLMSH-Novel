Debug woke with a start. She couldn't understand what was being yelled at her, but she knew they were furious.

She could see daylight, and someone tall casting a shadow over her yelling at her. 

Before she could grasp what they were angry about they stormed off.

Before they could come back with a stick or something worse to ward her off she took matters into her own hands and clawed at the ground to find purchase.

Her eyes were bleary and crusted closed, but even then she could see the bruises on her arms blossoming worse than she'd seen yesterday. Trying to push her self up on all fours was excuriaiting, her arms could barely take their own weight, let alone her torso's. After some helpful screaming to get her blood pumping, she got into a kneel and they started trying to pull herself up the wall and get her legs underneath her.

For all the pain her arms were in, everything from her waist down felt like it was gone. 

She could make her legs move.

But felt 

As she stepped forward, bracing herself against a wall for balance, it was an incredibly surreal sensation to not feel anything. No weight, no pain, nothing. It was like waiting for pins and needles to get better except without the feeling of static noise.

After a few test steps, Debug found she could still feel pressure around the edges of her feet and a few spots on her leg. With a few more hesitant steps she declared herself safe to walk and started mechanically marched herself away.

She had picked this spot originally because the dumpsters she was hiding behind had only paper in them and no terrible smells and could hide her from the road. But if that wasn't an option she'd need to find somewhere she could sit and recover her energy before maybe going to the hospital.

She couldn't go anywhere she could be seen from the road or cornered.

In the current state she was and and what they had shown they were capable of, Debug didn't want to put her current self to a physical test.

Maybe if she could find somewhere she could arm herself with a stick she could rest a little more comfortably.

Trouble felt like a willing hostage at this point and didn't know how to improve the mood.

She was sitting in the front passenger seat while Sinéad drove and Brun sat in the middle back seat, head on a swivel trying to take in everything.

When Brun had told her something had happened to Debug she didn't believe her. But the longer she spent time with Brun's ongoing anxiety and now adding Sinead's to the mix, she couldn't help but also be caught up in that feeling.

They had driven all over town at this point. Both Sinéad and Brun had made a series of suggestions on where Debug would hide, but no one had been right yet. 

Trying to ratchet down on the tension, Trouble decided to try and talk about something pleasant rather than let everyone stew in silence.

"What was Bug like when she was younger, Miss Bruce?" She realised after letting the words out, that she hoped Bug had been right in their guess of if Sinéad was married and kicked herself for not having the courage to call her by her first name.

"What?" Sinéad turned to look at Trouble like they'd forgotten she was sitting there. "Uhh...she was a gift." Her eyes back on the road as she spoke, but with a far away look Trouble recognised seeing her father making a lot. "She would push herself to the limit a lot. Then snap and start fights, then chill and repeat. She had a lot happen to her at such a young age. But she never trusted me enough to let me keep her."

"Is that why you don't share a last name?" Brun piped up from the back seat. "I know she changed her name, but she didn't change it to be like you." She seemed angry, Trouble wasn't sure if they were angry at the lack of progress or that Bug's mom had been so close this whole time and still absent. "She literally changed her name to be No Last Name. She didn't feel welcome in any family, and you think you can claim to be her mom." 

Sinéad looked equally angry, but held her tongue. 

But only for a moment.

"She left before I could explain anything to her." Sinéad snapped back, unable to hold herself back. "I was going to..." The words died in her mouth.

"Well, I can see where Dee gets it from. Clearly keeping these sorts of secrets keeps everyone safe and gives them someone they know they can rely on. Ohh wait, she didn't ask for your help, I did." Trouble could hear the words cut both ways, Brun was as angry at herself as she was Sinéad.

The car aggressively swerved and parked, mounting the curb.

"Everyone out!" Sinéad barked.

Trouble stepped out of the car, and tried to take in her surroundings.

Everything she saw put her on edge.

***

Brun was not sure why she was so angry, but if Sinéad wanted a fight she could throw down.

She stepped out of the car on the street side and looked down on Sinéad. This woman, had been right here the whole time. She had seemingly known where Dee was working, had missed her. 

And done what?

Nothing?

Brun knew exactly how isolated and scared Dee could be, they worked so incredibly hard to put on a tough face. But when they sighed or had a quiet moment watching some couple or family check in while she had no one Brun knew that stuff tore her up inside.

She couldn't fathom what Sinéad had thought just cause Dee had fled them once before that nothing could be done? To Give up? She knew Dee was like a bruised cat, playful but cautious. It wasn't through one big act, it was from being reliable that you make them trust you.

Brun hated herself just as much, because while she knew this she also had let Debug be. Decided that rather than risk letting them trust her and that she might fail that she would just be 'respectful' instead.

(Almost a physical altercation between Brun and Sinéad)

A stifled scream cut into her focus.

"Trouble!" She shouted as she let go of the shorter woman and tried to find her friend.

The footpath was empty.

Trouble was gone.

There was nothing about, just a construction site and some closed businesses. 

Sinead's terrible parking meant she had to clamber over the back of their car to get to the footpath.

The construction site had wooden cladding up all around the site, except for the nearby entrance.

Brun immediately stalked towards it, looking for any sign of her friend.
