Debug woke with a start. She couldn't understand what was being yelled at her, but she knew they were furious.

She could see daylight, and someone tall casting a shadow over her yelling obscenities. 

Before she could grasp what they were angry about they stormed off and she was blasted by the full force of the sun as their shadow left with them. Before they could come back with a stick or something worse to ward her off she took matters into her own hands and clawed at the ground to find purchase and escape again.

Her eyes were bleary and crusted closed, but even then she could see the bruises on her arms blossoming worse than she'd seen yesterday. Trying to push her self up on all fours was excruciating, her arms could barely take their own weight, let alone her torso's. After some helpful screaming to get her blood pumping, she got into a kneel and they started trying to pull herself up the wall and get her legs underneath her.

For all the pain her arms were in, everything from her waist down felt like it was gone. 

She could make her legs move. That was evident by looking at them, though she very much didn't want to.

But she felt nothing when they moved.

As she stepped forward, bracing herself against a wall for balance, it was an incredibly surreal sensation to not feel anything. No weight, no pain, nothing. It was like waiting for pins and needles to get better except without the feeling of the buzzing static noise.

After a few test steps, Debug found she could still feel pressure around the edges of her feet and a few spots on her leg. With a few more hesitant steps she declared herself safe to walk and started to mechanically march herself away swaying a little as she fought to keep her balance.

She had picked this spot originally because the dumpsters she was hiding behind had only paper in them and no terrible smells and could hide her from the road. But if that wasn't an option anymore she'd need to find somewhere she could sit and recover her energy before maybe going to  hospital.

As much as she didn't want attention, not being able to feel her legs was unnerving and deeply concerning. She was still exhausted though, so she wanted to rest a little longer before trying to work out where she was and how she'd get to a hospital from here.

She couldn't go anywhere she could be seen from the road or anywhere she could be cornered. But with how slow she was moving being cornered was the least of her worries.

In the current state she was in and and what "they" had shown they were capable of, Debug didn't want to put her current self to a physical test. SO more than being not visible from the road, she needed somewhere she could properly hide.

Maybe if she could find somewhere she could arm herself with a stick she could rest a little more comfortably.

Trouble felt like a willing hostage at this point and didn't know how to improve the mood.

She was sitting in the front passenger seat while Sinéad drove and Brun sat in the middle back seat, head on a swivel trying to take in everything.

When Brun had told her something had happened to Debug she just didn't believe her. But the longer she spent time with Brun's ongoing anxiety and now adding Sinead's to the mix, she couldn't help but also be caught up in that feeling.

She didn't know how much panic a call going to voice mail over and over could give her until today.

They had driven all over town at this point. Both Sinéad and Brun had made a series of suggestions on where Debug would hide, but no one had been right yet. They'd looked in enclaves of bushes and trees, abandoned shops, cafés Bug knew the managers names of, parking structures and called every nearby hospital to see if they'd been badly injured enough to go there.

Every failed idea had made the group more anxious and more depressed and now they all say in tense silence, out of ideas and running out of hope.

Trying to ratchet down on the tension, Trouble decided to try and talk about something pleasant rather than let everyone stew in silence.

"What was Bug like when she was younger, Miss Bruce?" She realized after letting the words out, that she hoped Bug had been right in their guess of if Sinéad was married and kicked herself for not having the courage to call her by her first name.

"What?" Sinéad turned to look at Trouble like they'd forgotten she was sitting there. "Uhh...she was a gift." Her eyes back on the road as she spoke, but with a far away look Trouble recognized seeing her father making a lot. "She would push herself to the limit a lot. Then snap and start fights, then chill and repeat. She had a lot happen to her at such a young age. But she never trusted me enough to let me keep her."

"Is that why you don't share a last name?" Brun piped up from the back seat. Trouble could feel Brun's grip on her seat ratchet higher that same tension from before. "I know she changed her name, but she didn't change it to be like you." She seemed angry, Trouble wasn't sure if they were angry at the lack of progress or that Bug's mom had been so close this whole time and still absent. "She literally changed her name to be No Last Name. She didn't feel welcome in any family least of all yours, and you think you can claim to be her mom." 

Sinéad looked equally angry, but held her tongue. 

But only for a moment.

"She left before I could explain anything to her." Sinéad snapped back, unable to hold herself back. "I was going to..." The words died in her mouth.

"Well, I can see where Dee gets it from. Clearly waiting to tell people things keeps everyone safe and gives them someone they know they can rely on. Ohh wait, she didn't ask for your help, I did." Trouble could hear the words cut both ways, Brun was as angry at herself as she was Sinéad.

The car aggressively swerved and parked, mounting the curb.

"Everyone out!" Sinéad barked.

Trouble stepped out of the car, and tried to take in her surroundings.

Everything she saw put her on edge.

***

Brun was not sure why she was so angry, but if Sinéad wanted a fight she could throw down.

She hadn't wanted to let Dee's mom be involved, but they had a car and she needed now more than anything reassurance her friend was safe and once she found Debug she needed to get it through their adorable but thick skull that she could have kept them safe. She stepped out of the car on the street side and looked down on Sinéad. This woman, had been right here the whole time. She had seemingly known where Dee was working, had missed her, had wanted to say things to her.

And done what?

Nothing?

Brun knew exactly how isolated and scared Dee could be, they worked so incredibly hard to put on a tough facade. But when they sighed or had a quiet moment watching some couple or family check in while she had no one Brun knew that stuff tore her up inside.

She couldn't fathom what Sinéad had thought just cause Dee had fled them once before that nothing could be done? To Give up? She knew Dee was like a bruised cat, playful but cautious. It wasn't through one big act, it was from being reliable that you make them trust you.

Brun hated herself just as much, because while she knew this she also had let Debug be. Decided that rather than risk letting them trust her and that she might fail that she would just be 'respectful' instead.

"I'm not surprised you think you need to step out of the car to try and intimidate me, I get that a lot from the police." Brun was too angry, she could feel her breath hot and stinging in her throat. She didn't need to be starting fights in the middle of nowhere next to a construction site or wherever they were. She needed to find Dee.

But this woman just rubbed her the wrong way.

Said things mattered and did nothing to show it. Acted like an authority but had no expertise to justify it. Claimed she was owed respect but had not earned it.

She stepped closer, looming over this woman. Fists balled, stance firm, eyes focused.

She wanted Sinéad to blink first, to yeild and acknowledge she had done wrong. Brun felt if she stepped back now, she would be admitting she wasn't going to try or do absolutely anything to help her friends.

A stifled scream cut into her focus.

"Trouble!" She shouted as she let go of the shorter woman she didn't realise she was holding and tried to find her friend.

The footpath was empty.

Trouble was gone.

There was nothing about, just a construction site and some closed businesses. 

Sinead's rushed parking meant Brun had to clamber over the back of their car to get to the footpath.

The construction site had wooden cladding up all around the site, except for the nearby entrance. She could see the brick walls of a building half complete peeking over the temporary walls.

Brun immediately stalked towards it, looking for any sign of her friend.

***

Felicity was sure this was how it would end.

Frank had appeared as if from nowhere, grabbed her in the way he often did around the neck in a headlock, and dragged her away.

She tried to scream, but he put a knife in her mouth. The taste of blood was instant and she felt herself go limp in panic. He forced her teeth to close around the knife and hold it in place while he dragged her further. All she could think about was the sensation of trying to relax her tongue and it constantly flexing and lolling against the blade.

She had no time to take in her surroundings as she was dragged further and further into the half-built building. She had no idea what sort of place this would end up being but it had so many twisting turns and nooks with construction material littered about even if she got free she wasn't confident she would be able to find her way back out.

Frank found the spot he was looking for and threw Felicity to the ground. Gingerly she extracted the knife from her mouth and tried to keep it between Frank and herself.

"What a fucking catch. Not going to let you get away twice, you're mine forever now." Frank gloated, fishing zip ties out of his tool belt.

Felicity looked around and worked out what was to come. Behind her was a half finished bit of scaffolding with plywood cladding around it, she was going to be sealed in a temporary wall to torture her like Frank had done before with her whole house. 

Felicity brought the knife up trying to ward Frank away. She either needed to buy time to escape, or buy time for Brun to come find her. 

The idea of Brun being impossibly capable clashed with the idea that Frank couldn't be fought. Felicity both wanted not to rely on hope too much, as fragile as it was, and to not dispair.

She screamed again. As loud as she could.

Frank kicked the knife out of her hands and bore down on her like an animal.

His sweaty weight crushing the wind out of Felicity's lungs. He grabbed for her hands and tied them together with a zip tie. He stayed laying on top of her, seeming to enjoy the act. 

"I'll have all the time I want with you later. Once I've broken that stubborn streak of yours. We left another girl in here the other week and she made all the noise she could and no one found her. I wonder how long you'll last before you promise everything under the sun for some food and water?" He got back up on his feet, he looked haggard, but he clearly still have enough strength to do whatever he wanted to her.

Frank grabbed her bound wrists and lifted her by them. The change in orientation almost made her choke on the blood pooling in her mouth, taking the opportunity she spat as much of it as she could at him.

He cursed at her and threw her to the ground again. Not able to move her arms freely and with her cast pressing painfully on her other arm she tried to scream again, but it came out more a grunt as the wind was knocked out of her again.

Once again, Frank picked her up and this time jammed her into the the space behind the scaffolding and zip tied her to some overhead bar. Her feet barely touched the ground and her shoulder were install in pain from the odd angle and bearing her weight.

All she could see from where she was the inside of the space she'd been jammed into and very little of the construction site behind Frank. Just more featureless walls and a tall pile of construction materials covered in a tarp. The dispair was starting to sink in and beat the hope out of her.

Felicity opened her mouth and felt blood flow out and down onto her shirt, she spent a few moments trying to calm her breathing. The door before her, the opportunity might be the last she got ever. The risk of being injured further was very high, she fully expected it. But taking her opportunities until now had been what saved her.

She took one last breath.

And she screamed.
