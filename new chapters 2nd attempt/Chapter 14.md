Debug was done with today. She just wanted to turn off like a computer and let today's problems be tomorrow's.

She trudged towards a bus stop well away from the mall carrying Trouble — who was certainly living up to their name – on her back.

Today had a lethal amount of emotional whiplash for stuff going wrong. She had spent the whole day reading books explaining scientific principles and cool natural phenomenon unable to take any of it in since all she could do was fantasize about the ideal version of the situation she was in. Just sitting at home enjoying time with a wife while they both quietly did something in the other's presence independently. 

*When they'd been prepping to go out in the afternoon and Debug was helping Trouble put on make up, it was all she could do not to start acting out a scene where she was a maid to a delicate princess and they were having an illicit affair behind their betrothed's back – Manager Beth's recounting of her smut book's plot had apparently had more of an impact than Debug thought.* 

*She had been feeling a bit bad about giving Debug so much physical attention recently that she had planned to spend the day with them so they wouldn't need any treats to help stay on top of their anxiety. But she had underestimated how restless her own desires for that same affection would make her. But once she had seen how calm Trouble was all day she couldn't just do something to make their day worse just to get herself an excuse to get some attention.* 

*There had been a few points where familiar ideas from her childhood had started to creep in. That she could just let people do what they wanted to her so she could get what she wanted. But this time it wasn't that sort of meal, but one to sate her heart's desires than her stomach's. That feeling of powerlessness, of knowing she was at the whims of another curdled her blood, and while she didn't like letting those thoughts exist, it did help keep her calm and stop herself from doing something reckless.*

But once they had left the hotel, she had a perfectly platonic physical act she could do to sate her lust: holding hands. After traveling all the way to the mall with Trouble hand in hand she understood why they never let go of Brunhilde's hand when they got the chance. Even in the present, Debug considered herself a pale imitation of Brun. Struggling where she knew the taller, stronger woman would succeed with ease.

On the point of struggling, seeing Sinéad again was a struggle. They had been the closest thing she had known to what people described as a mother. It had been a struggle to not throw themselves into their arms and beg to be taken home, to simply let herself break. To fall apart and and let someone else take care of them. But having Trouble's hand in theirs, having them try to reassure her despite the challenges of their arm in a cast.

It wasn't her lot to be allowed to be soft and cared for.

When Sinéad had spoken, in her disarming and personable voice, Debug simply pretended she was once again back in high school and in incredible amounts of trouble for flaunting some rule or getting into a fight. Using the style of poetic and metaphoric codewords she used back then to let Sinéad know what was going on before anyone else got a chance to. It had been going well, she had felt in control and could see a path out of the conversation with her sanity intact.

But Sinéad had broken her own rule.

In the brief time they lived together, they had always let Debug decide the emotional scope of their conversations. If she put up a wall, they wouldn't try to sneak past it. But not today it seemed. 

Not if she wasn't a helpless child.

Not if they wanted something badly enough.

She might feel less harsh about the whole conversation in a week or two. Once they were far enough from the conversation that it wasn't a clear memory any more.

But while she was wrapped up in her own thoughts, something had happened to Trouble. When she had refocused Trouble was very out of it and was trying to bend her wrist despite her cast. As soon as they stopped hyperventilating and relaxed they fainted in Debug's arms. 

Debug was glad she had dialed back in when she did, the fact she was already holding Trouble's head as they collapsed prevented them from getting a concussion. Lifting them off the ground was another matter entirely. Brunhilde had always made carrying Trouble around look easy.

Thankfully, a very keen group of teens had been nearby and they had jabbered several theories on why Trouble had fainted and none of them sounded serious. They settled on some blood pressure issue when Debug had mentioned it wasn't the first time this month that they'd been out cold. 

They had helped Debug get Trouble up on her back to give them a piggy back 'out to the car' or so she lied.

She'd actually just trudged several bus stops away, not feeling safe at the the ones near the mall and fearing Sinéad would somehow see them, or worse the officer who she'd been seemingly out on a date with. She needed to be relied on right now, and letting Sinéad back into her life wouldn't let her be strong enough. In fact, Debug was sure if she let anyone know how fragile she actually was she wouldn't be able to consider herself strong enough to be relied upon ever again.

The long, slow walk had been a good time to get on top of her emotions and work out what needed to be repressed or ignored and set aside for later. 

This incident would likely spell the end for any outings Trouble would feel safe enough to go out on, and Debug did feel responsible as she was what had brought attention to them.

"I don't think I'm any good. You might be called Trouble, but I'm trouble incarnate. You should learn from today and make better friends."

Reaching the bus stop finally, and with great difficulty set Trouble down on the seat and started waiting for them to wake up.

Brun refused to lose every argument she had with herself. One would think she was also winning the arguments since it was with herself. But the side she wanted to win simply wasn't.

She had spent her whole previous shift fretting about how to talk to either Debug or Trouble about how she had been feeling, and every time she tried to imagine what they might say she could never find words to explain how she felt to herself, let alone to other people.

As she walked back into the hotel for her next shift, hoping that by being in the building she was expecting to have a fight in she could imagine a better outcome than her friends rebuffing her and decrying her lacking of positive emotion around sexual interests. 

She had spent all her waking hours thinking on the subject and was feeling less dread about the prospect of romance. She might have been conflating too many things with something she didn't like. She could imagine happy scenarios where someone did nice things for her and gave her a gift or a chaste kiss, or a warm embrace. Where she could be physically intimate in a kind way. But trying to imagine anything more serious was off-putting.

Maybe part of the problem was how inexperienced she was. 

"But it's just sex. What else is there? You have the primal urge then you do the deed." She muttered to herself and the nearby crow she had befriended that frequented their car park. "If you don't get the urge you don't do the deed. It's not like you can add rules like it's football or something fun." 

Setting her internal discussion aside, Brun walked through the front door to meet the eye of Gary. One of the few staff she now dreaded doing a handover with.

Minutes later, as she walked into the staff room behind the reception she found an odd situation: Manager Beth was still where she had last seen her, eight hours ago, sitting in front of the management computer. Except now she had notes and what looked like timelines strewn about the desk.

"You find that guy you were looking for?" Brun asked, now a little concerned this meant Trouble wasn't safe.

"What?" Beth scrambled to cover her notes. "Ahh, no. There was a guest taking something that didn't belong to them. So I was tracking their movements to see what they took." They got up from their seat and faced Brun. "What are you doing here?"

"Beth...it's 7pm. I'm here for the start of my shift." Brun gave her manager the most withering look she could manage. "What are you doing here?"

"If I stop now, the tape's get erased with the month roll over." Beth said looking like her exhaustion was rapidly catching up to her.

"Is it worth being a total wreck?" She didn't particularly care what Beth looked like, and they were surprisingly put together for someone who was approaching 26 hours awake. But she knew Beth would judge herself harshly if they thought they weren't presentable for others.

"I'll go lay down in the nap room for a hot minute. But this...this is important." They appeared to re-inflate with the reassurance to themselves they could continue planning their vendetta.

"What did the guest even steal? What's worth this much effort?" Brun was a little worried, the hotel didn't have anything of actual value and began thinking someone had started stripping the copper pipes and wires from the rooms.

"I had a snack I was saving. And they stole it." Beth's eyes flashed with a very serious energy. Brun wrote it off entirely and put the whole nonsense from her mind.

"You steal that...I'll do worse..." Beth muttered as they staggered away.

Brun began trying to imagine her friends not getting angry at her, first she needed to work out how Debug would think.

***

Debug felt wrung dry and sun bleached, which was odd for someone who'd not been directly in natural light all day and felt like they had a thin film of half dried sweat covering their body.

They could march for a long while still, but they were very glad they hadn't needed to carry Trouble any further than the bus stop. 

Debug had muscles, enough to get herself into mischief; apparently not enough to get herself back out of it. She was used to using engineering to multiply her strength rather than simply being as strong as needed. She strongly suspected her terrible eating habits were part of why she had stayed short and never put on muscle, but it could be inherited for all she knew since she didn't share a drop of blood with anyone who had called themself her parent.

Trouble firmly held her hand and walked by her side rather than trailing behind her as they had done when they had left the hotel several hours earlier. She wasn't sure what about fainting from seemingly nowhere had given them a confidence boost, but since waking back up at the bus stop they hadn't hidden behind Debug since. That or they knew it had been as bad as it was because Debug hadn't seen anything leading up to the problem, so if they stayed in her peripheral vision Debug would be able to help quicker.

Either way, as they approached the hotel front door, Debug stopped and bowed to her companion gently kissing their hand. The act being the furthest thing from chaste purity they'd done all day. As debug looked back up to see their reaction she caught a sly smile being smothered. Hopefully being playful would help smooth over their rough evening.

"Good evening then. It has been most wonderful, except for the minor hiccough towards the end." Trouble said through an incredibly thick fake British accent. Before taking the lead and entering the hotel.

Debug didn't like what they saw inside. 

Manager Beth had a wild look in their eyes and Brun stood behind the reception like they had just been told an incredibly personal insult.

"Debug!" They both said in unison.

"I have a question I need to ask you." Manager Beth steamrolled over whatever Brun was trying to say. "Since there's a few people here do you mind taking a walk with me while I say my piece?" Their face was unreadable, but they looked both exhausted and totally wired.

Brun visibly deflated for some reason, Debug hoped Trouble didn't assume it was their fault.

"I'll come back and we can chat later, okay?" She said as she nodded at Brun before following Beth as they walked out the back of the reception.

Debug was unsure what was going on as she followed Beth through the back rooms of the hotel. They normally didn't ask anything of her unless something technical broke, and it was just to explain what was broken so she wouldn't get price gouged by repairmen. But from where she was leading her, the only thing out this way was the fire escape and utility rooms.

As Beth lead Debug down yet another maintenance corridor she had never bothered to explore, they stopped a few steps ahead and looked like they took something out of their pocket. They turned back to look at Debug and the only thing that stood out was one of Beth's eyes was vigorously held shut, like she'd got dust in it.

Darkness fell.

The whole corridor went pitch black 

No sounds rang out except the sizzle of the lights overhead quickly cooling.

Debug was incredibly blind in the darkness.

Weirdly, they couldn't hear anything either. As though the sudden lack of light affected their ears too.

They did have a hand on the rail that ran the length of the hall and could feel an odd trill like metal on metal.

Before they had a chance to react or ask if Beth was okay, they felt metal close around their wrist.

Handcuffs.

Debug tried to pull her hand back and recoil, but the other end of the cuffs must have been further along the rail as she couldn't move far.

Panic seized her heart.

A second handcuff seized her other wrist and wrenched her arm up.

The sound of the other end being closed around something above her rang out.

Both arms now spread wide and unable to protect her body. Sensing her vulnerability, Debug tried to turn side on to where she expected violence from.

The heel of a boot struck her near the hip and pushed her off balance.

The cuffs held tight and stopped her from falling to the ground but her arms and shoulder flashed pain into her mind as they suddenly caught her body weight. A cruel hand grabbed her jaw and forced her to look up into the darkness. 

"You're my trophy. My prize." Debug hated how right she had been for not wanting to trust Beth. "And that scuffed slut takes your lips before I did?"

Debug went limp and stopped trying to struggle, the panic died as familiar feeling of being physically trapped settled in. She knew what most people like this wanted, and giving up quickly would be her best bet in the short term. If she wanted a chance to be alone with the handcuffs to break free she would need Beth to think they were foolproof.

"Ohh, giving in so soon, Pet?" Debug flinched at that word. "I expected you to put on a brave face, you always talked such a big game." Rough hands groped at Debug's arms.

As she hung there, senses getting accustomed to the dark, she heard a noise that made her stomach drop. The sound of a box cutter knife extending.

A hand grabbed at her shirt. She knew what was coming next.

Taking measured and controlled breaths and trying to stay calm while Beth cut the front of her shirt and bra leaving her chest exposed for no one to see.

Several flashes in the dark proved her wrong. As Beth took a photo of her crimes. Debug concluded they were either going to let her go and blackmail her or not let her go and maybe murder her. 

She felt incredibly numb.

The pain from her arms was easy enough to ignore. 

With a bit of effort in the current situation she could probably dissociate entirely. Just not be present for what happened next.

She'd have new nightmares for sure. But if she let go of her own mind for a bit, she could focus more on escape later than protecting herself now.

She didn't expect any help to come, Beth could just leave and put up a sign saying no entry. And since she was the only person on staff trusted to ignore such signs, no one would think to check inside.

A noise brought Debug back to the present. A buzzing noise.

Beth had cut her pants too, and was clearly threatening her with a small vibrator. Debug regretted coming back. Something as annoying as that would be very hard to dissociate away from.

Suddenly the picture slid into focus. Today was the last day of the month, Beth would have been looking at the cameras and seen Trouble and her kiss at least once. If they had been entitled and possessive as they were acting she could guess they had an imagined slight and wanted to mark her in some way.

Now all she needed to know was what Beth thought they wanted. If she could either pretend to give them that or actually give them what they wanted they might leave her alone.

She didn't know if this waking nightmare was worse than knowing Sinéad knew she was nearby or not.
