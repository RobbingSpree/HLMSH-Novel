Debug was done with today. She just wanted to turn off like a computer and let today's problems be tomorrow's.

She trudged towards a bus stop well away from the mall carrying Trouble — who was certainly living up to their name – on her back.

Today had a lethal amount of emotional whiplash for stuff going wrong. She had spent the whole day reading books explaining scientific principles and cool natural phenomenon unable to take any of it in since all she could do was fantasize about the ideal version of the situation she was in. Just sitting at home enjoying time with a wife while they both quietly did something in the other's presence independently. 

When they'd been prepping to go out in the afternoon and Debug was helping Trouble put on make up, it was all she could do not to start acting out a scene where she was a maid to a delicate princess and they were having an illicit affair behind their betrothed's back – Manager Beth's recounting of her smut book's plot had apparently had more of an impact than Debug thought. 

She had been feeling a bit bad about giving Debug so much physical attention recently that she had planned to spend the day with them so they wouldn't need any treats to help stay on top of their anxiety. But she had underestimated how own desires for that same affection. But once she had seen how calm Trouble was all day she couldn't just do something to make their day worse just to get herself an excuse to get some attention. 

There had been a few points where familiar ideas from her childhood had started to creep in. That she could just let people do what they wanted to her so she could get what she wanted. But this time it wasn't that sort of meal, but one to sate her heart's desires than her stomach's. That feeling of powerlessness, of knowing she was at the whims of another curdled her blood, and while she didn't like letting those thoughts exist, it did help keep her calm and stop herself from doing something reckless.

But once they had left the hotel, she had a perfectly platonic physical act she could do to sate her lust: holding hands. After traveling all the way to the mall with Trouble hand in hand she understood why they never let go of Brunhilde's hand when they got the chance. Even in the present, Debug considered herself a pale imitation of Brun. Struggling where she knew the taller, stronger woman would succeed with ease.

On the point of struggling, seeing Sinéad again was a struggle. They had been the closest thing she had known to what people described as a mother. It had been a struggle to not throw themselves into their arms and beg to be taken home, to simply let herself break. To fall apart and and let someone else take care of them. But having Trouble's hand in theirs, having them try to reassure her despite the challenges of their arm in a cast.

It wasn't her lot to be allowed to be soft and cared for.

When Sinéad had spoken, in her disarming and personable voice, Debug simply pretended she was once again back in high school and in incredible amounts of trouble for flaunting some rule or getting into a fight. Using the style of poetic and metaphoric codewords she used to use to let Sinéad know what was going on before anyone else got a chance to. It had been going well, she had felt in control and could see a path out of the conversation with her sanity intact.

But Sinéad had broken her own rule.

In the brief time they lived together, they had always let Debug decide the emotional scope of their conversations. If she put up a wall, they wouldn't try to sneak past it. But not today it seemed. 

Not if she wasn't a helpless child.

Not if they wanted something badly enough.

She might feel less harsh about the whole conversation in a week or two. Once they were far enough from the conversation that it wasn't a clear memory any more.

But while she was wrapped up in her own thoughts, something had happened to Trouble. When she had refocused Trouble was very out of it and was trying to bend her wrist despite her cast. As soon as they stopped hyperventilating and relaxed they fainted in her arms. 

Thankfully they here already holding Trouble's head as they collapsed; so preventing them from getting a concussion was a simple matter. Lifting them was another.

Thankfully, a very keen group of teens had been nearby and they had jabbered several theories on why Trouble had fainted and none of them sounded serious. They settled on some blood pressure issue when Debug had mentioned it wasn't the first time this month that they'd been out cold. 

They had helped Debug get Trouble up on her back to give them a piggy back 'out to the car' or so she lied.

She'd actually just trudged several bus stops away, not feeling safe at the the ones near the mall and fearing Sinéad would somehow see them, or worse the officer who she'd been seemingly out on a date with. 

The long, slow walk had been a good time to get on top of her emotions and work out what needed to be repressed or ignored and set aside for later. 

This incident would likely spell the end for any outings Trouble would feel safe enough to go out on, and Debug did feel responsible as she was what had brought attention to them.

"I don't think I'm any good. You might be called Trouble, but I'm trouble incarnate. You should learn from today and make better friends."

Reaching the bus stop finally, and with great difficulty set Trouble down on the seat and started waiting for them to wake up.

Brun refused to lose every argument she had with herself. One would think she was winning the arguments since it was with herself. But the side she wanted to win simply wasn't.

She had spent her whole previous shift fretting about how to talk to either Debug or Trouble about how she had been feeling, and every time she tried to imagine what they might say she could never find words to explain herself or how she felt to herself, let alone other people.

As she walked back into the hotel, hoping that by being in the building she was expecting to have a fight in she could imagine a better outcome than her friends rebuffing her and decrying her lacking of positive emotion around sexual interests. 

Having spent all day while awake thinking on the subject, she was feeling less dread about the prospect of romance. She could imagine happy scenarios where someone did nice things for her and gave her a chaste kiss, or a warm embrace. Where she could be physically intimate in a chaste way. But trying to imagine anything more serious was off-putting.

Maybe part of the problem was how inexperienced she was. 

"But it's just sex. What else is there? You have the primal urge and do the deed." She muttered to herself and the nearby crow she had befriended that frequented their car park. "It's not like you can add rules like it's football or something fun." 

Setting her internal discussion aside, Brun walked through the front door to meet the eye of Gary. One of the few staff she now dreaded doing a handover with.

Minutes later, as she walked into the staff room behind the reception she found an odd situation: Manager Beth was still where she had last seen her, eight hours ago, sitting in front of the management computer. Except now she had notes and what looked like timelines strewn about the desk.

"You find that guy you were looking for?" Brun asked, now a little concerned Trouble wasn't safe.

"What?" Beth scrambled to cover her notes. "Ahh, no. There was a guest taking something that didn't belong to them. So I was tracking their movements to see what they took." They got up from their seat and faced Brun. "What are you doing here?"

"Beth...it's 7pm. I'm here for the start of my shift." Brun gave her manager the most withering look she could manage. "What are you doing here?"

"If I stop now, the tape's get erased with the month roll over." Beth said looking like her exhaustion was rapidly catching up to her.

"Is it worth being a total wreck?" She didn't particularly care what Beth looked like, and they were surprisingly put together for someone who was approaching 26 hours awake. But she knew Beth would judge herself harshly if they thought they weren't presentable for others.

"I'll go lay down in the nap room for a hot minute. But this is important." They appeared to re-inflate with the reassurance to themselves they could continue their vendetta.

"What did the guest even steal? What's worth this much effort?" Brun was a little worried, the hotel didn't have anything of actual value and began thinking someone had started stripping the copper pipes and wires from the rooms.

"I had a snack I was saving. And they stole it." Beth's eyes flashed with a very serious energy. Brun wrote it off entirely and put the whole nonsense from her mind.

"You steal that...I'll do worse..." Beth muttered as they staggered away.

Brun began trying to imagine her friends not getting angry at her, first she needed to work out how Debug would think.

Debug felt wrung dry and sun bleached, which was odd for someone who'd not been directly in natural light all day and felt like they had a thin film of half dried sweat covering their body.

They could march for a long while still, but they were very glad they hadn't needed to carry Trouble any further than the bus stop. 

Debug had muscles, just not a lot of them. She was used to using engineering to multiply her strength rather than simply being as strong as needed. She strongly suspected her terrible eating habits were part of why she had stayed short and never put on muscle, but it could be inherited for all she knew.

Trouble firmly held her hand and walked by her side rather than trailing behind her as they had done when they had left the hotel several hours earlier. She wasn't sure what about fainting from seemingly nowhere had given them a confidence boost. That or they knew it had been as bad as it was because Debug hadn't seen anything leading up to the problem, so if they stayed in her peripheral vision she'd be able to help quicker.

Either way, as they approached the hotel front door, Debug stopped and bowed to her companion gently kissing their hand. The act being the furthest thing from chaste purity they'd done all day. As debug looked back up to see their reaction she caught a sly smile being smothered.

"Good evening then. It has been most wonderful, except for the minor hiccough towards the end." Trouble said through an incredibly thick fake British accent. Before taking the elad and entering the hotel.

Debug didn't like what they saw inside. 

Manager Beth had a wild look in their eyes and Brun stood behind the reception like they had just been told an incredibly personal insult.
