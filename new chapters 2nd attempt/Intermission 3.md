Deborah recalls it all
***

Her eyes felt like they'd crusted over, it took effort to blink until they opened normally.

She could see a hospital room. She was in yet another hospital bed.

She couldn't move her arms or really any part of her body.

She felt like she was in a dream, her body refused to tell her what was going on and her memory was very fuzzy.

Someone stood over her, a shillouette she recognised.

"Mom?"

The person started to cry. She had probably messed something up again.

"Deborah, I'm so glad you're ok. I was so worried. When I saw all the blood...I just..." Their words trailed off. That was a voice she knew too, but it sounded more tired than she knew. Older maybe.

"That's not my name." Deborah tried to explain. "That's from before." She didn't know where she knew this fact. But it was as immutable as her name.

"What?" The familiar person asked trying to take her hand.

"Mel met June..." The words tumbled out of her like a practiced prayer. "June found Jill. Jill helped Deh. And they all bore..." A name swam to the front of her mind. "Me." Debug could feel herself weaping, but she didn't have the energy to wipe the tears or even stop crying.

Sibéan sat in a chair next to her bed also crying while clutching at her hand, trying to avoid the serious number of tubes coming out of her.

"I'm sorry." Debug said, not sure what for yet.

Brun knows murder isn't the answer

***

"She fucking what?" Brun lost her cool entirely this time pinching the bridge of her nose and fighting back further swear words. "What do you mean she was raped?"

"Ma'am, I can understand your concern. But if it helps we didn't find any genetic material?" The nurse tried to placate the matter.

"My girlfriend is in there, recovering from god knows what. And you're saying while fighting the world's most homophobic flight of stairs, she was raped?" As the words spilled out of Brun her voice kept raising higher and higher until it started to sound like a squeak. "And it's a good thing we don't have any leads on the creep that did it?" Brun had been trapped into calling Dee her girlfriend when she learned they had listed her as their emergency contact and had ticked defacto spouse on the form. She knew Dee could bend paperwork to suit her needs, but this probably warranted talking to her first.

It was, however, a fact she didn't correct. She never would. Under more pleasant circumstances would have been touched they thought of her as someone who would come to their rescue, someone they would live with for long enough the government needed to be told. But she had to agree to a lot of stuff quite suddenly to not lose her access to her friend while they were treated.

Some of the nurses had got wires crossed and had congratulated her on dating Trouble instead, remembering her from her other recent visit with a damaged waif. And because she was more preoccupied with keeping up with Dee's progress and the doctors informing her just how many ways from Sunday Dee had fucked herself by sleeping on a back ally while bleeding out in clothes she had stolen from a dumpster, the consensus between the nurses now become that they thought she was dating both Dee and Trouble.

This fact she didn't correct either. She never would. Under more relaxing circumstances that would probably be the dream. But having both her crushes be brought back to the hospital together made it seem like she was doing a terrible job fighting off potential suitors or jilted ex's. Which if Brun thought about it, was probably true.

"So, from the top: fractured wrist, fractured hip, a lot of infections, a little necrosis, and rape." The word fell out of her mouth like a lead weight. She needed to find a way to point Sinéad at whoever was responsible for this. She could take care of nursing Dee back to health, but she couldn't go to jail for righteous vengeance in the first degree. 

"If we ignore the contusions, concussion, and lacerations, yes." The nurse added.

"When will she be well enough for a hug? She needs at least a hug after everything she's been through." Brun rolled her eyes, fighting the urge to make a scene. She knew the nurse wasn't to blame. Some scumbag out there was, but the need to punch something was overwhelming. When she got home she was going to see if she could tear a phonebook in half as a way to channel these emotions into something that wouldn't get her arrested.

"According to her chart, gentle pats on her right shoulder for now. Or entwining fingers, her fingers managed to get out of this pretty unscathed. Normally for a battery and rape there's all sorts of defensive wounds on the hands and..." The nurse stopped talking, apparently catching on that they weren't helping thanks to the intense gaze Brun was boring into them with.

"Good to know, platonic shoulder pats for now. Doctor's orders." Brun muttered and returned to her sleeping princess's bedside.

Trouble has no choice but to say it

***

"That's about all I can think of at the moment." Trouble sighed and tried to relax. Sinéad sit next to her hospital bed with a stern look and the police detective she'd brought to take statements was looking frustrated with her. "I didn't realise how much of it I even could forget." 

"It'll be a lot harder to pin anything beyond the assault he did yesterday with just this." Trouble didn't know how to recall anything more, when she had talked about it with Bug all her problems just felt like they could flow out of her and never return. Like they could vanish into the depths of Bug's kind eyes and pull the wounds right off her heart. But Sinéad wasn't as safe or comforting as Bug. Instead she would have to package it all up in an organised and digestible way the police could use.

"Maybe ask open ended questions? That seemed to help when Bug and I talked about it." Trouble didn't want to end up getting discharged with no protections from Frank or from his police friends. She might never feel safe to go outside again, the memory of her dates with Bug and Brun and the desire to have more of them was an effective motivating force.

She could feel herself tearing up at the thought of being trapped in her home again.

"Like about when he staged the robbery."

"He what?!"

"Yeah, it's what lead to me being trapped in my house for so long"

"You were what?"

"After I found out...he started trying to blackmail me with something." Felicity felt like throwing up, she was talking as matter-of-factly as she could but inside she felt like death trying to explain how things used to be. 

She had been in denial for so long, wanting to pretend that it was just stress or anxiety rather than malevolence. That being that much at risk and at the mercy of someone's cruel whims was still so close and so possible that it might happen again.

"I think Bug called it Revenge Porn." Felicity started to lose control of herself. Her breathing became ragged, her vision swam with tears. She snatched a mug from her bedside and emptied it into her lap before throwing up in it.

Bug had been so mad when she had heard that. The swiftness and ferocity of her embrace had felt like it might break Felicity's bones, but somehow Debug had come away bruised instead, but their rage had felt reassuring at the time; the urge that someone wanted to fight on her behalf. Knowing it was a fight worth pursuing. She didn't realize how much it had helped until now.

"I want to see her." Felicity pleaded, she didn't know who she meant. But if she was allowed to roam the halls of the hospital her feet would tell her. Even if she was bound to a wheelchair for now.

"I just have a few more questions." The detective seemed ambivalent to her reaction to her own history. Sinéad also looked unimpressed.

If they expected her to keep going, it must mean this was the expected result and she was supposed to put up with it.

"Then get me a bucket, because I think my cup is full."
