"I don't want you talking to any of my patients, actually." Debug woke up to a voice she recognized, it was the doctor who had been explaining exactly how badly she was going to be fucked over by the recovery process yesterday. She hoped that the last time they spoke was only yesterday. "I don't trust you alone with anyone in this hospital after your last interview."

So much of her time in hospital was just fading in and out of consciousness. It was difficult to relax when she didn't know if she was awake or not, especially when her dreams she was having kept being about things she would rather forget.

When she had been awake last, she had been thinking about what name to change to next. As not being the same person who bad things had happened to them was what had made getting over all her previous issues possible.

"The longer we leave this, the longer her assailant has to destroy evidence and make my job impossible." Sinead's voice filled the room as it was want to do. "Do you want more people coming in with injuries like this."

"I think this young lady was uniquely capable in making her condition worse, but also I want to see this person stopped." While Debug tried to rouse herself fully so she could voice her opinion the doctor spoke again. "I'll give you five minutes, and if she seems distressed I will put a stop to this and you. She needs rest, not to relive her traumas."

She could hear the doctor walk out of the room and close the door behind them. There was a few tense moments of silence where she could feel Sinéad moving about the room even if she couldn't hear her.

Suddenly, Debug felt on fire. Her heart hammered in her chest and the exhaustion from moments prior felt like a lie.

Looking around the room she could see Sinéad standing next to her IV lines having just added something into it.

"Deh, tell me who did this to you." Her voice was cold, Debug didn't think she had ever seen her this angry before. If she even was angry on her behalf. She could just as likely be angry she was forced to talk to her runaway ward and be responsible for them again.

"I can deal with my own issues. You don't have to put yourself out for me." She watched nothing change about Sinead's face and felt vindicated in her assessment.

"So all those cuts you got? Just circumstantial?"

"I overestimated how well I'd fit through a window, and wasn't wearing protective clothes. It's my own fault so I'll deal with it."

"And the concussion?" 

"Would you believe I don't remember? Concussions tend to do that to you." Sinead's face was unmoved still. Every answer Debug gave felt like a self-inflicted gut punch, Sinéad seemed to care nothing for how she was coping. She must assume Debug could do more, could withstand more, was disappointed that once again Debug had found herself under the heel of yet another abuser.

"The doctor said you were raped you know?"

"Concussion wasn't kind enough to let me forget that."

"And who did it?"

"You want her name?" Debug was confused now, something about that last answer had rattled Sinéad. Finally her expression changed, to one Debug recognised. Sinéad was thinking as hard as she could as quickly as she could. 

When they had lived together Debug had loved watching Sinéad think, how she could take a swath of info and deduce an answer. But over time it became less of a novelty and instead another way she felt like not a person but a collection of problems to be solved in Sinead's eyes.

"Your boss?"

"Beth, yeah she raped me and jammed vibrators and dildos and other nonsense in me, and when I didn't play along she got handsy. Dunno how long for, but if my doctor is to be believed long enough to cause damage." Debug could feel tears flowing freely down her face, she refused to let it reach her voice, to sound like someone who still needed saving.

She remembered few things clearly from when she was cuffed in that corridor, but when she couldn't disassociate out of the situation she had silently pleaded for someone, for anyone, to save her.

And as always...no one did.

"That what you wanted to hear? How once again I was violated? I've told you enough different ways when I was younger you'd think you would be over it by now. But if that's how you get your jollies, who am I to question?" 

Suddenly Sinéad picked up a cheap looking metal chair in the corner of the room and slammed it back down warping it's shape almost flat.

"Not the answer you were looking for? Did you hope this was all self inflicted instead?" Debug knew she was being cruel. But she would either finally force Sinéad to step away fully and stop pretending to be family, or force them closer to actually act like she had been told a mom would act. Her hanging by the fingertips to Debug's life wasn't doing either of them any favours.

Sinéad stormed out of the room.

Debug wept and wept, alone again in her hospital room, until the adrenaline wore out and she fell back into further nightmares.
