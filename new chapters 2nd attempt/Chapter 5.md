Trouble felt like a balloon on a string tied to Brunhilde's wrist. Bobbing around helplessly and being pulled along as Brun went about their day.

She had tried sitting in her room, but the lack of anyone else present after spending the whole previous day with Brun made get hair stand on end. She had jumped at shadows and noises for an hour before deciding to try and find Brunhilde as they worked. And now, she didn't feel much better.

Yesterday, or earlier in the day (her sleep schedule was messed up and she had lost track of what day was what), being able to spend time with Brunhilde while neither of them actually had to do work was very nice. Very low stress, like how she had imagined spending time with friends after work would have been. But this was a pale shadow of that ideal.

Brunhilde walked around the hotel doing all sorts of jobs, cleaning rooms, manning the reception, helping carry luggage, managing the setup and the tidy up of the dining room, and all sorts of other small jobs. She also learned Brun's muscles weren't for show. Trouble had tried to help put a fitted sheet on a single corner of a bed, only for Brun to do the other three corners and then come finish hers putting her efforts to shame.

Trouble spent some time doing her best to not think about how safe she felt in Brun's arms, but had very little else safe to think about. Almost everything else that came to mind put her dangerously close to letting her emotions overwhelm them and bursting into tears. Which, while she could rely on Brun to help her get calm again, she didn't want to keep doing that in case she wore through Brunhilde's patience or interest.

Currently, she was feigning interest in a leaflet she was pretending was her phone, having a pretend phone call and looking out the window â€” all while Brunhilde actually did her job and talked to some guests who wanted more towels or something. She was trying to come up with a plan on what to do about her own job once tomorrow morning arrived, no access to her computer or phone was going to make explaining the situation a lot harder than it needed to be.

She pulled at the open zipper on Brunhilde's jacket that she was still wearing. While she couldn't get an actual hug, and might cry if she did, this was comforting enough for now. Trouble was mixed on wanting the weather to clear up, if it did her clothes under the jacket wouldn't look as out of place, but if it didn't she could keep wearing the jacket and no one would question it's necessity. Though it was still necessary either way; as she was still wearing nothing but a singlet and no bra under the protection of the jacket.

"Hey, Trouble." Brunhilde's hand appeared on her shoulder seemingly as soon as her thoughts had consumed her. Though in all likelihood she had been ignoring Brun calling out to her. "It's getting towards dinner, do you wanna go wait in your room and I'll come by with some food? Not my cooking, but it'll be warm at least?" Brun flashed a friendly smile as they turned to leave. A warm smile that made her feel safe.

Trouble smiled in return, a warm feeling bloomed in her tummy. Her smile got wider. She found herself trying to cover her mouth and keep the feeling to herself. A moment of worry that she wouldn't be able to keep this emotion under wraps lurched from within her mind. 

Felicity's joy turned to panic in a heartbeat. 

Standing exposed and vulnerable in the middle of a hallway with nowhere to hide or avoid the gaze of anyone who happened to pass by. 

She almost lost balance as she pulled the hood down over her head and eyes and started to stumble back to her room. 

Felicity became very aware how much noise she was making and had the horrific thought of throwing the jacket off and away to stop it making noise and drawing attention to her. 

Practiced reflexes kicked in and she stopped breathing. Lungs ached as her chest tried to heave and force air to move. Her stomach muscles flexed and stopped everything moving in her abdomen. She could feel her diaphragm flitting wildly like the heartbeat of a tiny scared animal. She stopped making any noises.

Moments passed in forced, controlled silence.

Flashes and spots appeared in her vision.

Her worry sank back into her mind.

She let a single controlled breath out and in.

Then held her breath again.

This time, her body didn't fight as much.

Her heart slowed and calmed.

As soon as possible, because she still felt exposed in the hallway, Felicity piloted herself like an unloved puppet back to her room to collapse and recover.

Brun stopped in place like an unfair crane game arm, a single cream puff in her hand. 

"I hope she doesn't have any dietary requirements." Brun mused to herself. "I've just been feeding her fried food and a single fruit. Avocados are fruit, right?" She posed the question to one of the line cooks she was poaching food from.

"Worse question: is it a vegetable?" They answered back, not looking up from their incredible dicing technique. Brun ignored their question and tried to get her train of thought back on track.

"I mean, I've been making sure they have meals and eating. But I'm bound to be making mistakes, heaven knows I've probably poked or prodded her in a bruise or six by now. But she has so many, she she's been favouring her right arm but writing with her left, and the graze on her jaw has been looking a bit rough today. It's just a lot to try and keep track of." Brun sighed deeply. "I've been doing a good job, right?"

"I slept with your therapist and they complained about you and your self doubt issues non-stop, Miss Brown. But we both agree you've been making great strides. Also, you have to get a new therapist." The line cook joked. Brun liked venting to the cooks, they were vicious with their humour, but she found it very grounding for someone to barely listen to what she had to say and still read her like a book.

"Thanks Barry. Can always count on you to be a voice of reason."

"I'm not Barry, Miss Brown. Barry doesn't work weekends, I'm Daveo. We talk almost every weekend." Daveo's voice stayed monotone the entire time and they seemingly never stopped cutting and dicing.

"Well you're a tosspot, Daveo. Couldn't even let me have this." Brun flashed a smile at him. "Now I owe Barry $20 cause he said you'd let that slide and I believed him." Brun picked up the two plates of food and made to leave.

"Before you go." Daveo interrupted, before quickly cutting an apple into a pair of delicate looking flowers. "This is a second fruit to feed your friend."

Minutes later Brun walked at her work speed down the hall to Trouble's room, two plates in hand. Upon reaching it she used the master key while it was still in her pocket to unlock the door and open it with her patented reversing dump truck technique. She swung around to take in Trouble's room and work out where to place the food.

The room was dark compared to the vibrantly lit halls, Trouble was sitting in a bulky chair in the corner under a lamp. The curtains drawn and none of the overhead lights were on, long shadows spread around the room. Brun took one of the decoratively cut apples and lobbed it to Trouble's left side. Trouble, for her apparent prowess, managed to snatch the Apple out of the air with deft precision. Only to wince and drop it, followed by a look of panic appearing as she snatched the apple from the air again with her right hand.

"Very swish, I'm impressed Trouble." Brun said as she sat down on the floor Infront of them and placed their plate of food on the arm of their chair. 

They sat are in silence, just the noise of chewing and utensils scraping. Brun didn't find the quiet to be uncomfortable, she spent a lot of her time looking up at Trouble and watching them exist near her. A lot of the time they had spent together had been quite emotionally fraught, so a relaxing meal with no one in tears was a nice change of pace. But as she had noted earlier and confirmed with the apple, Trouble was apparently concealing an injury in their left hand.

They would do normal motions like picking up food with a fork with their left, but for cutting or chasing a morsel of food around the plate shed swap which utensil when in which hand for those tasks.

"Trouble, I've been meaning to ask..." Brun started, setting her mostly finished plate aside and moved to a kneeling position so she could get closer to eye level. "What sort of bumps and bruises do you have? Cause if hate to try and help you only to make stuff worse or poke you somewhere delicate." Brun reached out and traced around where she remembered a splotchy bruise on Trouble's knee was.

"This isn't actually that bad..." Trouble said, peeling her protective jacket back and examining her own skin. Gingerly poking and prodding some of her own injuries. "I mean, I've got a few from...getting into fights...but you've not done anything wrong." They frowned at a few of their injuries as they moved from one to the next.

"I'm not perfect, Trouble. I'm bound to make mistakes." She reached and took Trouble by the wrist to avoid their hand injury. "We've only just met and I don't know all your secrets, I don't need to. I just want to keep you safe, I only ask so I don't move thoughtlessly and hurt you. Like your hands, you look like you're left handed, but you've been treating it so delicately all day. And when I passed you the apple just now, it made it look like that made it worse. I don't want to put you in a position where you're forced to make an injury worse from my negligence."

"Ahh, no, that's...it's a injury from work." Trouble stammered, their eyes flitting away and back from Brun's own gaze. "I draw for work, and do other stuff too. Graphic design and digital art and copy writing and project management, but too much drawing can give you a repeated strain and that makes my wrists a bit tender, especially in around stormy weather" Trouble turned their attention to their hands, turning them over and sliding their arms in Brun's loose grip but never removing them. They sighed and relaxed into Brun's touch. 

Brun felt like they were quick to change the topic, which made sense, she wouldn't want to dwell on her own failures too long either. Glancing back up from Trouble's hands to meet their eyes and froze.

Their face was rapidly becoming very pale.

Their arms felt limp in her hands.

Brun noticed their chest heaving and heard no breathing. 

Something was very very wrong.

***

Trouble felt like a fairground ride that was falling apart mid-ride. 

It felt like screaming, but not with her voice.

Like burning while feeling deathly cold.

Like something was very very wrong with her left arm.

All her strength left her. She stopped breathing as a reflex. Echoes of her pain and worry bounced back to her mind from all her extremities. 

And as suddenly as it started it stopped.

Trouble felt Brun's hands cupping her cheeks, the injuries and bruises there had nothing that could compete with the pain her arm had been radiating. By comparison, everything else felt mute. Though the strength in her arms didn't feel like it was coming back at all.

Worry and panic gripped her heart.

What if she was simply broken now? 

What if, after all this, she had just started to come undone? 

Like a car which somehow keeps running when it's entirely rust that finally drives over a pothole and now something crucial breaks. 

What if there was no saving what was left of her.

Debug felt drowsy and muted, like a sock full of sand. And worse still, her phone was ringing.

Walking over to the handset and picking it up without checking the caller ID.

"Crimes and other services, you've reached the commissions office." Debug announced into the handset, she was confident there was a better way to answer the phone, but her mind was mush at the moment.

"You know about injuries and stuff, right?" Bee asked through the phone, skipping any helpful context. "Can I describe what I've just seen and you tell me what it is?"

Debug thought for a moment before, before forgetting half of what Bee had said and assumed this was about insects or birds they had seen and wanted to know the species of.

"Go ahead and describe you thing." Debug grabbed a pen and paper to write stuff down knowing her short term memory couldn't be relied on.

"Ok, umm...so if you touch it they go really pale. And it's tender, I don't know if there's any related bruising."

"Bruising?" Debug interjected, confused about a beetle that could bruise when they didn't have blood or a vascular system.

"Yeah, on her arm."

"They have arms? Not just legs?"

There was a long pause from the other end of the call.

"Yeah, you saw them before. This is something that happened to Trouble." Debug could hear Bee's confusion in their voice and her brain rebooted.

"Ok, describe the injury again from the top." She scribbled out the notes she'd taken so far.

"Ok, right. She's got lots of bruises, so I don't know if it's related to any one. But if we put weight on the inside of her arm or squeeze her forearm kinda anywhere it hurts a lot and she loses all strength in both her arms."

"Does it feel really loud?" Debug asked the silent participant of the call. Already having flash backs to when she last fell out of a tree. 

A pause long enough for Trouble to have the question conveyed and responded passed before Bee spoke again.

"Yeah, what does that mean though?" Bee sounded confused again, which told Debug they'd managed to not break a bone themselves.

"Broken bone, likely a fracture if only one axis of movement causes pain. Go to the hospital and get it in a cast. Also, stop poking it for science." Debug, having finished explaining the issue hung up and then regretted her choice.

"I could have chatted more, this was the first time in ages that Bee was the one to call me."

She flopped about on her bed. While her sleep had been cut short, she was too awake now and would have to get up.

Debug flounced about her apartment in her underwear, one of the only benefits to having a cheap apartment in the middle of her building with no windows was that the building wide HVAC system ran past several of her walls and leeched heat in keeping it toasty and acceptable for flouncing.

She picked up a book of crosswords, this month's new special interest, and started work on a puzzle she'd left unsolved, when her phone rang again.

"Ohh, the crime support line is popular today. Greetings, foolish mortal, state your business."

"What would you do if it was an important call, do you answer all your calls like that?"

"I give businesses and people I don't want to call me fake numbers or fax numbers. What other questions do you have for me today, Bee?" The voice was easy to recognise with Bee's telltale rasp.

"Right, I don't want to say we should do crimes, but Trouble has said she's worried if we go to the hospital the police might come and get her. And I don't know what to do about the police, and you're the one Beth calls when she wants the police to leave the hotel...soooooo..." Bee was being very diplomatic today, normally she'd put her foot in her mouth and just say she wanted to do illegal stuff.

"Right, subtle hospital visit. You've got your wallet on you today Bee, right? Then use that. Insurance and Medicare cards don't have photos on them and I've just given them a business card when they want proof of my address and they'll normally accept that. They don't really care, they just want the post code." 

There was a longer than expected pause from Bee.

"Did you catch all that, Bee?" Debug let none of her worry into her voice. "Take her to the hospital and have her pretend to be you. No record in her name, no way any cops will be called since you're not known associates yet." She was sure she had implied to Bee that she'd done impersonation and identity theft before today so this shouldn't be a revelation to them.

"Sorry, I was explaining it to Trouble. You're too reliable, Dee. I owe you." Bee's voice finally broke the silence again.

"Well thanks for using your friendly neighborhood crime commission. Please stay on the line for an automated survey." She waited until she hung up before she let herself breath normally. She was going to have to start avoiding Beth if they were getting back on her case about her history. The stress from earlier was still affecting Debug and she knew was jumping to conclusions.

Before she could get back into her crossword, her phone rang again. Expecting some kind of comeuppance with Bee's warning and with the rule of three, she checked the caller ID this time. Her blood ran cold.

Beth's personal number was the caller ID.

Not the front desk. Not her work phone. Not Bee again.

Debug was incredibly tempted to let it ring out. 

Just not answer it. Not face Beth again, until she felt safe.

But to do that would raise too much suspicion that something was wrong, would prompt more attention and questions than keeping a distance.

"Miss Nolastnam speaking. How can I direct your call?"

"Dee, it's me again, sorry. I left my phone in Trouble's room. Can I ask you to come down to the hotel and cover the end of my shift? Beth will be here too, so you're not alone and without friends. Please?"
