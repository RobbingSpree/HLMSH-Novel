Trouble felt like a balloon on a string tied to Brunhilde's wrist. Bobbing around helplessly and being pulled along as Brun went about her day.

She had tried sitting in her room, but the lack of anyone else present after spending the whole previous day with Brun made get hair stand on end. She had jumped at shadows and noises for an hour before deciding to try and find Brunhilde. And now, she didn't feel much better.

Yesterday, or earlier in the day (her sleep schedule was messed up and she had lost track of what day was what), being able to spend time with Brunhilde while no one actually had to do work was very nice. Very low stress, like how she had imagined spending time with friends after work would have been. But now she felt awkward.

Brunhilde walked around the hotel doing all sorts of jobs, cleaning rooms, Manning the reception, helping carry luggage, managing the setup and assumably the tidy up of the dining room, and all sorts of small jobs. She also learned Brun's muscles weren't for show, when she had tried to help put a fitted sheet on a bed with great effort, only for Brun to do the other three corners and then come finish hers in the same time.

Trouble spent some time doing her best to not think about how safe she felt in Brun's arms, but had very little else to think about. Almost everything else that came to mind put her dangerously close to losing her cool and bursting into tears. Which, while she could rely on Brun to help her get calm again, she didn't want to keep doing in case she wore through Brunhilde's patience or interest.

Currently, she was feigning interest in a leaflet she was pretending was her phone, having a pretend phone call and looking out the window, all while Brunhilde actually did her job and talked to some guests who wanted more towels or something. She was trying to come up with a plan on what to do about her own job come tomorrow morning, no access to her computer or phone was going to make explaining the situation a lot harder.

She pulled at the open zipper on Brunhilde's jacket that she was still wearing. While she couldn't get an actual hug, and might cry if she did, this was comforting enough for now. Trouble was mixed on wanting the weather to clear up, if it did her clothes under the jacket wouldn't look as out of place, but if it didn't she could keep wearing the jacket and no one would question it's necessity. Though it was still necessary either way; as she was still wearing nothing but a singlet and no bra under the protection of the jacket.

"Hey, Trouble." Brunhilde's hand appeared on her shoulder seemingly as soon as her thoughts had consumed her. Though in all likelihood she had been ignoring Brun calling out to her. "It's getting towards dinner, do you wanna go wait in your room and I'll come by with some food? Not my cooking, but it'll be warm at least?" Brun flashed a warm smile as she turned to leave. A warm smile that made her feel safe.

Trouble smiled in return, a warm feeling bloomed in her tummy. Her smile got wider. She found herself trying to cover her mouth and keep the feeling to herself. A moment of worry that she wouldn't be able to keep this emotion under wraps lurched from within her mind. 

Felicity's joy turned to panic in a heartbeat. 

Standing exposed and vulnerable in the middle of a hallway with nowhere to hide or avoid the gaze of anyone who happened to pass by. 

She almost lost balance as she pulled the hood down over her head and eyes and started to stumble back to her room. 

Felicity became very aware how much noise she was making and had the horrific thought of throwing the jacket off and away to stop it making noise and drawing attention to her. 

Practiced reflexes kicked in and she stopped breathing. Lungs ached as her chest tried to heave and force her mouth open. Her stomach muscles flexed and stopped everything moving in her abdomen. She could feel her diaphragm flitting wildly like the heartbeat of a tiny scared animal. She stopped making any noises.

Moments passed in forced silence.

Her worry sank back into her mind.

She let a single controlled breath out and in.

Then held her breath again.

This time, her body didn't fight as much.

Her heart slowed and calmed.

As soon as possible, because she still felt exposed in the hallway, Felicity piloted herself like an unloved puppet back to her room to collapse and recover.

Brun stopped in place like an unfair crane game arm, a single cream puff in her hand. 

"I hope she doesn't have any dietary requirements." Brun mused to herself. "I've just been feeding her fried food and a single fruit. Avocados are fruit, right?" She posed the question to one of the line cooks she was poaching food from.

"Worse question: is it a vegetable?" They answered back, not looking up from their incredible dicing technique. Brun ignored their question and tried to get her train of thought back on track.

"I mean, I've been making sure they have meals and eating. But I'm bound to be making mistakes, heaven knows I've probably poked or prodded her in a bruise or six by now. But she has so many, she she's been favouring her right arm, and the graze on her jaw has been looking a bit rough today. It's just a lot to try and keep track of." Brun sighed deeply. "I've been doing a good job, right?"

"I slept with your therapist and they complained about you and your self doubt issues non-stop, Miss Brown. But we both agree you've been making great strides. Also, you have to get a new therapist." The line cook joked. Brun liked venting to the cooks, they were vicious with their humour, but she found it very grounding for someone to barely listen to what she had to say and still read her like a book.

"Thanks Barry. Can always count on you to be a voice of reason."

"I'm not Barry, Miss Brown. Barry doesn't work weekends, I'm Daveo. We talk almost every weekend." Daveo's voice stayed monotone the entire time and they seemingly never stopped cutting and dicing.

"Well you're a tosspot, Daveo. Couldn't even let me have this." Brun flashed a smile at him. "Now I owe Barry $20 cause he said you'd let that slide and I believed him." Brun picked up the two plates of food and made to leave.

"Before you go." Daveo interrupted, before quickly cutting a tomato into a pair of delicate looking flowers. "This is a second fruit to feed your friend."

Brun walked at her work speed down the hall to Trouble's room, two plates in hand.
