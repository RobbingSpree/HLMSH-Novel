Debug felt like everything was falling apart. Her life, her patience, her capacity to hold her pee.

She had driven the car for about thirty minutes before she had the panic inducing thought that since the car was hotel property Beth might report it stolen once they noticed it was gone and she didn't need the police making things worse right now.

First thing she did was drive to a nearby mall and parked near a concrete barricade to hide her nudity behind, it had a clothing donation bin for charity for the convenience of shoppers and escapees alike. The place was utterly empty for the dead of morning, letting Debug actually relax and unclench for the first time since part way through her date with Trouble. Her lock picks made quick work of the charity bin and in short order she had stollen a new shirt and shorts to cover up with and a library bag to jam her bloody rags in and the least worst sandals to protect her feet.

As she got dressed she caught several glimpses of the mess she had made of herself in her escape. She added her arms from the elbows down and her body from the chest down to her list of things to ignore at all costs. 

The pain, on the other hand, was far too all encompassing to ignore.

Now she had achieved the difficult part of actually escaping her adrenaline was swiftly wearing off. Every part of her body ached, any time she stopped moving she could feel her pulse across her whole body. With every beat of her heart the chorus of pain grew louder.

Folding herself back into the car involved a lot of painful screaming, but since she had started she might as well go through with the next step of her plan. Through tear-streaked vision, she parked and abandoned the car on a random residential street. If she needed to go somewhere a lot further in a pinch she could come back and re-steal it.

But the most important thing now was hiding.

Existing was taxing enough. Being seen or discovered by other people would be too much.

She had a lot of time to think about what had happened as she limped away looking for somewhere to hide. After a reasonable amount of sleepless worry sitting huddled in a corner between two buildings Debug confidently come to the conclusion that she was to blame for the whole situation.

She had been on edge about Beth for months, the prying, the comments, the trying to be important to her. They must have been trying to get her to drop her guard so they could do something like this for ages. It was only after she had come back exhausted and vulnerable that she'd been attacked.

She needed to be more vigilant, more on guard. To keep everyone at arms length. To be safe and not at risk for once.

If Beth had those twisted desires while Debug had been trying to keep a wall up between them, then what's to say what Brunhilde wouldn't do the same if they found her? She had been trying to flirt with Brun for months with seemingly no result, had she been digging her own grave this entire time.

Beth had stolen Debug's phone, pocket knife and house keys when she'd been cuffed to the wall, but that might be for the best. Without a phone she couldn't be tracked, and as long as she never went back home no one would be able to find her again, and in a city with lots of glass bottles littered about there was always something she could use as a knife nearby.

Without her phone she couldn't contact Sinéad, but with how convenient their timing was for popping back into her life they probably couldn't be trusted either. Sinéad had been the reason she had needed to change her name so many times, she would have been able to stick with her childhood name if she hadn't let Sinéad talk her into testifying and attracting so much attention.

Brun was furious, nothing made any sense and she was getting nowhere.

One of the few things she knew for certain about Debug is: if they didn't want people to know something it would just be impossible to learn. But that bit both ways, now they were in trouble she couldn't do anything to help them, cause the dork had kept everything so close to her chest.

Beth had called from Debug's house, but where even was that? Whoever had removed Debug from the hotel computer had erased her only lead on where to start looking. She had hoped that since Beth needed everyone's address for the police check when they first started working she could break into Debug's house and search for clues. If Beth could get in so could she, it couldn't be that hard.

Trouble trotted after her at a short distance, she didn't know where she was going, but staying at work wasn't going to get her any answers.

She needed to calm down and think this though again. 

Months ago Dee had tried to explain how to approach solving riddles, it was the closest thing she had ever heard to how they thought. She knew she wouldn't be able to out fox Dee, but could Dee out fox themselves?  (Include actual way to solve riddles)

While she was at the computer she had pulled up the security cameras for the last day or so and hadn't seen Dee after a quick scour of the footage. She had last been seen with Beth, but if Beth was looking for clues at their house they weren't at work anymore, Beth would have searched the hotel first before trying her house. If they didn't go home and wanted to not be found they'd need different clothes.

Brun turned around a strode back towards the hotel. If all Dee's spare clothes were still at work she would have the disguise she needed, if not she often mentioned finding good stuff in the second hand shops. 

Trouble might have been saying something as Brun walked but she was entirely focused on her train of thought. 

How would Dee get new clothes without going to a store? If she was trying to stay away from security cameras how could she get the same thing? Stealing them off clothes lines? Taking directly from charity bins? Mugging someone for their clothes?

Brun brust through the hotel front doors as much as someone could burst through automatic doors and made her way to the draw in then reception desk Dee kept all her stuff in. It was jam packed with clothes still. The lack of reception staff at the desk saving her from needing to explain herself.

"This used to just be a shirt, socks and her thieving tools." Brun muttered to herself as she pulled the contents of the drawer out. "Trouble, grab a pen and paper and write my phone number on it would you?" She said as she handed her phone to Trouble, open to show her own details.

"I'll write a few in case we need to leave more of these around." Trouble responded in a tone of voice Brun was unfamiliar with, they sounded confident and capable. Setting aside this new side of Trouble, she jammed the note in the drawer stood back up and left the hotel again.

She scoured the parking lot, once again at a loss to what to do. The drawer didn't have Dee's picks, which meant she could functionally get new clothes anywhere. Her only lead gone again again.

The hotel car was gone, but that made sense. If Beth was worried she would have driven off to get to Dee's house as quickly as she could.

Something about that seemed wrong, she had stopped checking the security footage when she saw Beth leave the hotel in a hurry and they were heading to the main road, not the back of the car park.

Dee had taken the car. 

The potential places to search had skyrocketed.

Brun screamed in frustration.

She had spent the last month helping Trouble confident she could do anything and help anyone. But the first sign someone she cared about was at risk she had been too polite to press them for details, so get to know them well enough that she could be relied upon.

Brun felt something tugging at her arm.

She had forgotten Trouble was even here. She had just tunnel visioned so hard she'd forgotten her other responsibility.

Trouble wasn't sure what was going on, but was trying her best to.

Brun had stood with her in the car park and just started unloading her worries and random trivia that lead her to believe Bug was somehow in danger.

It didn't seem like that was the case to Trouble. Debug in her mind was infallible, like Brun, someone who could do no wrong, nor any wrong come to them.

Except...

Except for the last date they'd been on...when Bug had been jumped by her mom, the police lady.

"Why don't we call the police?" Trouble asked

Brun stared at her like she had grown a second head.

"Honestly I don't think the police would care, nor do I think they could do a good enough job to find Dee!" Brun shouted, getting louder and louder as she went.

"What about her mom?"

Brun did a literal double take. Trouble had never seen someone actually do that outside of a cartoon.

"Her WHAT?" Brun sat down where she stood, apparently unable to comprehend that Debug had family.
