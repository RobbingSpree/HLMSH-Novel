Debug felt like everything was falling apart. Her life, her patience, her capacity to hold her pee.

She had driven the car for about thirty minutes before she had the panic inducing thought that since the car was hotel property Beth might report it stolen once they noticed it was gone and she didn't need the police making things worse right now.

First thing she did was drive to a nearby mall and parked near a concrete barricade, it had a clothing donation bin for charity for the convenience of shoppers and escapees alike. The place was utterly empty for the dead of morning, letting Debug actually relax and unclench for the first time since she had left the hotel with Trouble. Her lock picks made quick work and in short order she had stollen a new shirt and shorts to cover up with and a library bag to jam her bloody rags and the least worst sandals to protect her feet.

As she got dressed she caught several glimpses of the mess she had made of herself in her escape. She added her arms from the elbows down and her body from the chest down to her list of things to ignore at all costs. 

The pain, on the other hand, was far too all encompassing to ignore.

Now she had achieved the difficult part of actually escaping her adrenaline was swiftly wearing off. Every part of her body ached, any time she stopped moving she could feel her pulse across her whole body. With every beat of her heart the chorus of pain grew louder.

Folding herself back into the car involved a lot of painful screaming, but since she had started she might as well go through with the next step of her plan. Through tear streaked vision, she parked and abandoned the car on a random residential street. If she needed to go somewhere a lot further in a pinch she could come back and re-steal it.

But the most important thing now was hiding.

Existing was taxing enough. Being seen or discovered by other people would be too much.

She had a lot of time to think about what had happened as she limped away looking for somewhere to hide. After a reasonable amount of sleepless worry as she sat huddled in a corner between two buildings Debug confidently come to the conclusion that she was to blame for the whole situation.

She had been on edge about Beth for months, the prying, the comments, the trying to be important to her. They must have been trying to get her to drop her guard so they could do something like this for ages. It was only after they had come back exhausted and vulnerable that they'd been attacked.

She needed to be more vigilant. To keep everyone at arms length. To be safe and not at risk for once.

If Beth had those desires while Debug had been trying to keep a wall up between them, then what's to say what Brunhilde would do if they found her? She had been trying to flirt with Brun for months with seemingly no result, had she been digging her own grave this entire time.

Beth had stolen Debug's phone, pocket knife and house keys when she'd been cuffed to the wall, but that might be for the best. Without a phone she couldn't be tracked, and as long as she never went back home no one would be able to find her again, and in a city with lots of glass bottles littered about there was always something like a knife nearby.

Without her phone she couldn't contact Sin√©ad, but with how convenient their timing was for popping back into her life they probably couldn't be trusted either.

Brun was furious, nothing made any sense and she was getting nowhere.

One of the few things she knew for certain about Debug is if they didn't want people to know something it would just be impossible to learn. But that bit both ways, now they were in trouble she couldn't do anything to help them.

Beth had called from Debug's house, but where even was that? Whoever had removed Debug from the hotel computer had erased her only lead on where to start looking. She had hoped that since Beth needed everyone's address for the police check when they first started working she could break into Debug's house and search for clues. If Beth could get in it couldn't be that hard.

Trouble trotted after Brun at a short distance, she didn't know where she was going, but staying at work wasn't going to get her any answers.

She needed to calm down and think this though again. 

Months ago Dee had tried to explain how to approach solving riddles, it was the closest thing she had ever heard to how they thought. She knew she wouldn't be able to out fox Dee, but could they put fox themselves. While she was at the computer she had pulled up the security cameras for the last day and hadn't seen Dee with a quick scout of the footage. They had last been seen with Beth, but if Beth was looking at their house they weren't at work anymore. If Beth couldn't find a trace of them they hadn't gone home either. If they didn't go home and wanted to not be found they'd need different clothes.

Brun turned around a strode back towards the hotel. If all Dee's spare clothes were still at work she would need a disguise, and she often mentioned finding good stuff in the second hand shops. 

Trouble might have been saying something as Brun walked but she was entirely focused on her train of thought. 

How would Dee get new clothes without going to a store? If she was trying to stay away from security cameras how could she get the same thing? 

Brun brust through the hotel front doors and made her way to the draw Dee kept all her stuff in. It was jam packed with clothes. The lack of reception staff at the desk saving her from needing to explain herself.

"This used to just be a shirt, socks and her thieving tools." Brun muttered to herself as she pulled the contents of the drawer out. "Trouble, grab a pen and paper and write my phone number on it would you?" She said as she handed her phone to Trouble, open to show her own details.

"I'll write a few in case we need to leave more of these around." Trouble responded in a tone of voice Brun was unfamiliar with, they sounded confident and capable.
