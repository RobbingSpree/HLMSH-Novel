Debug felt like everything was falling apart. Her life, her patience, her capacity to hold her pee.

She had driven the car for about ten minutes before she had the panic inducing thought that since the car was hotel property: Beth might report it stolen once they noticed it was gone and she didn't need the police appearing and making things worse right now.

The first thing she did was drive to a nearby mall and park near a concrete barricade to hide her nudity behind, it had a clothing donation bin for charity in the car park for the convenience of shoppers and escapees alike. 

The place was utterly empty for the dead of morning, letting Debug actually relax and unclench for the first time since part way through her date with Trouble. 

Her lock picks made quick work of the charity bin and in short order she had stollen a new shirt and shorts to cover up with and a library bag to jam her bloody rags in and the least worst sandals to protect her feet.

As she got dressed she caught several glimpses of the mess she had made of herself in her escape. She added her arms from the elbows down and her body from the waist down to her list of things to ignore at all costs. 

The pain, on the other hand, was far too all encompassing to ignore.

Every part of her body ached, any time she stopped moving she could feel her pulse across her whole body. With every beat of her heart the chorus of pain grew louder. Her legs felt like lead, slow and painful to move and concerningly wet. She had been exhausted when she got back from carrying Trouble home and hadn't slept since. She was running on less than fumes at this point, now she had achieved the difficult part of actually escaping her adrenaline was swiftly wearing off. 

Folding herself back into the car involved a lot of painful screaming. Putting on her new shorts had been difficult, but she'd managed it without having to bend at the waist. The car was going to be covered in her DNA after this with how much she could feel herself sweating...she hoped it was just sweat. But since she had started she might as well go through with the next step of her plan. 

Through tear-streaked vision, she parked and abandoned the car on a random residential street. If she needed to go somewhere a lot further in a pinch she could come back and re-steal it.

But the most important thing now was hiding.

Existing was taxing enough. Being seen or discovered by other people would be too much. If she could rest for a while, she could recover her energy and then go find something to eat.

She had a lot of time to think about what had happened as she limped away looking for somewhere to hide. After a reasonable amount of sleepless worry sitting huddled in a corner between two buildings Debug confidently come to the conclusion that she was to blame for the whole situation.

She had been on edge about Beth for months, the prying, the comments, the trying to be important to her. They must have been trying to get her to drop her guard so they could do something like this for ages. It was only after she had come back exhausted and vulnerable that she'd been attacked.

She needed to be more vigilant, more on guard. To keep everyone at arms length. To be safe and not at risk for once.

If Beth had those twisted desires while Debug had been trying to keep a wall up between them, then what's to say what Brunhilde wouldn't do the same if they found her? She had been trying to flirt with Brun for months with seemingly no result, had she been digging her own grave this entire time.

Beth had stolen Debug's phone, pocket knife and house keys when she'd been cuffed to the wall, but that might be for the best. Without a phone she couldn't be tracked, and as long as she never went back home no one would be able to find her again, and in a city with lots of glass bottles littered about there was always something she could use as a knife nearby.

Without her phone she couldn't contact Sinéad, but with how convenient their timing was for popping back into her life they probably couldn't be trusted either. Sinéad had been the reason she had needed to change her name so many times, she would have been able to stick with her childhood name if she hadn't let Sinéad talk her into testifying and attracting so much attention.

Brun was furious, nothing made any sense and she was getting nowhere.

One of the few things she knew for certain about Debug is: if they didn't want people to know something it would just be impossible to learn. But that bit both ways, now they were in trouble she couldn't do anything to help them, cause the dork had kept everything so close to her chest.

Beth had called from Debug's house, but where even was that? Whoever had removed Debug from the hotel computer had erased her only lead on where to start looking. She had hoped that since Beth needed everyone's address for the police check when they first started working she could break into Debug's house and search for clues. If Beth could get in so could she, it couldn't be that hard.

Trouble trotted after her at a short distance, she didn't know where she was going, but staying at work wasn't going to get her any answers.

She needed to calm down and think this though again. 

Months ago Dee had tried to explain how to approach solving riddles, it was the closest thing she had ever heard to how they thought. She knew she wouldn't be able to out fox Dee, but could Dee out fox themselves?  (Include actual way to solve riddles)

While she was at the computer she had pulled up the security cameras for the last day or so and hadn't seen Dee after a quick scour of the footage. She had last been seen with Beth, but if Beth was looking for clues at their house they weren't at work anymore, Beth would have searched the hotel first before trying her house. If they didn't go home and wanted to not be found they'd need different clothes.

Brun turned around a strode back towards the hotel. If all Dee's spare clothes were still at work she would have the disguise she needed, if not she often mentioned finding good stuff in the second hand shops. 

Trouble might have been saying something as Brun walked but she was entirely focused on her train of thought. 

How would Dee get new clothes without going to a store? If she was trying to stay away from security cameras how could she get the same thing? Stealing them off clothes lines? Taking directly from charity bins? Mugging someone for their clothes?

Brun brust through the hotel front doors as much as someone could burst through automatic doors and made her way to the draw in the reception desk that Dee kept all her stuff in. 

It was jam packed with clothes still. The lack of reception staff at the desk saving her from needing to explain herself.

"This used to just be a shirt, socks and her thieving tools." Brun muttered to herself as she pulled the contents of the drawer out. "Trouble, grab a pen and paper and write my phone number on it would you?" She said as she handed her phone to Trouble, open to show her own details.

"I'll write a few in case we need to leave more of these around." Trouble responded in a tone of voice Brun was unfamiliar with, they sounded confident and capable. Setting aside this new side of Trouble, she jammed the note in the drawer stood back up and left the hotel again.

She scoured the parking lot, once again at a loss to what to do. The drawer didn't have Dee's picks, which meant she could functionally get new clothes anywhere. Her only lead gone again again.

The hotel car was gone, but that made sense. If Beth was worried she would have driven off to get to Dee's house as quickly as she could.

Something about that seemed wrong, she had stopped checking the security footage when she saw Beth leave the hotel in a hurry and they were heading to the main road, not the back of the car park.

Dee had taken the car. 

The potential places to search had skyrocketed.

Brun screamed in frustration.

She had spent the last month helping Trouble; confident she could do anything and help anyone. But the first sign someone she cared about was at risk that perspective fell apart, she hadn't pressed Dee hard enough to prove she was trustworthy, to prove that she could be relied upon.

Brun felt something tugging at her arm.

She had forgotten Trouble was even here. She had just tunnel visioned so hard she'd forgotten her other responsibility.

***

Trouble wasn't sure what was going on, but was trying her best to.

Brun had stood with her in the car park and just started unloading her worries and random trivia that lead her to believe Bug was somehow in danger.

It didn't seem like that was the case to Trouble. Debug in her mind was infallible, like Brun, someone who could do no wrong, nor any wrong come to them.

Except...

Except for the last date they'd been on...when Bug had been jumped by her mom, the police lady.

"Why don't we call the police?" Trouble asked

Brun stared at her like she had grown a second head.

"Honestly I don't think the police would care, nor do I think they could do a good enough job to find Dee!" Brun shouted, getting louder and louder as she went.

"What about her mom?" In response Brun did a literal double take. Trouble had never seen someone actually do that outside of a cartoon.

"Her WHAT?" Brun sat down where she stood, apparently unable to comprehend that Debug had family.

"Yeah, I met her the other while we were on a date." Trouble ommited her own collapse as it was clearly not as serious. "Bug said they were a Sargent. Sargent Sinéad...umm Bruce?" Brun just sat there with her mouth open blinking and making a lot of different expressions that all were different kinds of confused or contemplative. "She said she worked at the head office."

"The state branch of the police have their office here." Brun interjected, finally coming out of her stupor. "We'll call and ask her if she knows where Dee goes to hide."

A quick visit back inside the hotel to use the computer later, Trouble was listening to the dial tone of the reception phone as Brun had put it on speaker.

"New South Wales Police, how many I direct you call?" The voice over the phone answered. Trouble was impressed with their dedication but did wonder if Sinéad would be up this early.

"Hi, I'm calling to talk to a Sargent Sinéad Bruce about her daughter." Trouble asked, very used to making cold phone calls to strangers for work.

"One sec, Sargent Bruce isn't at her desk, let me see if she left anything about this." The police receptionist sounded like they were typing, Trouble hoped they were actually looking stuff up and not just making noises before saying no. "Ohh an old one. Ok, can I get your name?"

"Trou-...Felicity Harbour." Felicity corrected. She could feel Brun giving her a look, but she was too anxious to find out what it was and just hoped things were fine. "We met the other day at the mall, her daughter introduced me as Princess."

"Okay, one sec while I check with her." The phone started playing the same song every government hold line played, for once Trouble didn't try to dance to it.

"I forgot that was your name." Brun's voice came out as a hushed whisper. Trouble turned to look at her and saw a silly smile on their face, she let go of a breath she didn't realise she was holding. "And Dee called you Princess too? What, was it her turn to use the brain cell that day?"

"One sec..." The police receptionist said, interrupting the music and their chat. "I'm just going to connect you now."

Tense moments passed as the phone made several concerning noises the Trouble hoped it was supposed to make while making a call transfer.

"Hello? You there?" A familiar voice asked through the phone in Bug's style of authoritative speaking.

"Hi, Sinéad, we met the other day."

"Get to the point, you have something about Deborah?" The emotion in their voice impossible to discern over the phone.

"Brun?"

"Right, yeah. I'm Debug's coworker her boss just called me in a panic saying something had happened to her from what I can gather she has her lock picks and a car, is there anywhere you know she would go if she was in trouble?" Brun sped through her explanation suddenly looking a lot more concerned again.

A silence hung in the air, disturbed only by Sinéad making thinking noises over the phone.

"Her boss? What exactly did they say?" Sinéad asked after a long pause.

"They called from her house-"

"No they didn't." Sinéad interjected. "Deh, hates people getting in her space."

"Why would they lie about that? And they kinda bragged about it too." Trouble watched Brun lose control of the conversation in the same way she knew Bug had tried to control the other day.

"Do you know somewhere Debug would go to be alone that isn't her house, Sargent?" Trouble interjected trying to steer them back onto the original topic.

"Hang on, I'm getting in my car. You lot work at the hotel on George St? I'll be there in five minutes." The phone call ended quite suddenly. 

Trouble was not sure she had made the right decision.

***

Brun already knew why she had never heard of Debug's mom before now, they were a bit of an asshole.

It hadn't taken an entire five minutes before they could hear the siren and Sinéad tore into the packing lot. She had swiftly taken over Brun's investigation, but was cut short when trying to go through the security footage and the system seized up and finished the automated deletion of the month's worth of security tapes, or as Beth liked to call it: Deep Storage. She had often said that if the cops wanted their footage they could do whatever fancy tech they had access to to peel the data back off it.

Sinéad, had swore loudly, but ultimately just started investigating personally rather than rely on the tapes.

Burn had shown her were the car normally sat and that it was empty, and one of the few things she had managed to show her (and reaffirm for herself) was Beth leaving on foot.

"There's a pile of shims in the bush?" Sinéad asked, she asked a lot more questions than Dee, but got essentially the same conclusions. 

"Yeah, when we first got the car we didn't have keys for it so Dee would use those to unlock it to test if the remote she made would work. Or if she misplaced the remote after getting it to work." Brun answered, she was having fun telling Dee's mom stories about her daughter she didn't know.

"So even if she didn't have the car's keys, she could make this go?"

"Yeah, I even got good at it, that car was very easy to hot wire. She was going to teach you next Trouble." Brun pulled Trouble closer as she spoke to her, not comfortable with letting them stray too far away.

"And the blood?" Sinéad asked matter-of-factly.

"The what?" Brun dragged Trouble over as she strode next to Sinéad. 

On the ground she could see a lot of dark spots on the ground she would have assumed were just dirt. But they reflected the light differently.

Sinéad followed the trail back to one of the walls of the hotel.

"I lose the trail over here. But either Deh took an injured person with her, or she's injured." Sinéad stood back up to her full height, almost reaching Brun's chest. "Get in the car, more eyes will help. There's a bunch of flashlights in the backseat."
