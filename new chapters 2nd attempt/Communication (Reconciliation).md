Brun sat in the ambulance, fighting the wobble and bounce of the ambulance trying to unseat her and more importantly fighting the urge to scream.

Trouble lay on a gerny, strapped in place while the whole ambulance swayed through traffic and seemingly over every pothole. Fresh bruises already blooming on her skin along her arms and her entire shirt stained red and brown from the construction dust and mysterious other fluids Brun wanted to ignore. Trouble's stomach  had a large wound pad stuck on to cover the gash she had got from Frank's handiwork, and Brun had been asked to apply constant pressure while they drove making ignoring why Trouble's shirt was stained a lot harder.

Next to Trouble was the paramedic that wasn't driving, with sea legs a crab fisher would envy, doing impressive work filling Debug's arms with IV lines. Brun had been avoiding looking at Dee for most of the drive so far, her heart twisting any time she glanced and saw the seemingly unstoppable woman brought low. Dee had, in her mind, been the one thing that was beyond everyone's reach, either through her skittishness or what she now knew as paranoia.

Several of her arguments with Sinéad earlier today had been on what the two of them considered was Debug's idea of safe. While none of the dumpsters she had suggested had their quarry hiding behind them, Sinéad always had a comment about how insecure or exposed the spot was and how Dee wouldn't pick somewhere so thoughtless. Brun was entirely in support of Debug not talking to Sinéad after this was over, they made a poor mother.

"Trouble, I need you to pull through this." Brun whispered, the wail of the ambulance's sirens mostly drowning her out but she didn't expect Trouble to hear her either. This was more for her own benefit. "I need to tell you how much you mean to me. I need you to be here tomorrow so I can tell you I love you. And I need you to kick my ass so I can tell Debug too, cause I'm still a bit scared of her."

"I can do that..." Trouble's quiet voice responded, though Brun pressing on her probably made it harder. "...but I don't think the doctors will let me kick anyone for a while." The fragile creature tried to smile up at Brun who burst into tears in response, Brun very much wanted to give her another kiss. Ever since she'd stepped across that threshold the previous night, every time she saw Trouble she wanted to hold her even closer, to reaffirm her love for them with more affection than before.

Brun had been sure that seeing Trouble slowly healing from her injuries had desensitized to serious injury, she had been sure helping the nurses tally all Trouble's injuries and listening to them speculate on how she got them had desensitized her to thinking about the moment her friend had been hurt. But half standing in the back of an ambulance, guilt ridden that she could have stopped both of the women she loved from getting this injured, Brun felt alone and terrified she had missed every opportunity to make sure her friends knew how much for loved and cherished them.

Felicity woke groggily, like rising out of a puddle of relaxing mud that at all times wanted to reclaim her. 

The first thing she saw was her knight and protector fighting off a doctor.

"I'll rest when I know they're going to pull through! I can't do "
