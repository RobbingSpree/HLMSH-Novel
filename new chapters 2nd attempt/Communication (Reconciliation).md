Brun half stood in the ambulance, fighting the wobble and bounce of the vehicle trying to unseat her and more importantly fighting the urge to scream.

Trouble lay on a gerny, strapped in place while the whole ambulance swayed through traffic and seemingly over every pothole. Fresh bruises already blooming on her skin along her arm and around her neck, and her entire shirt stained red and brown from the construction dust and mysterious other fluids Brun wanted to ignore. Trouble's stomach had a large wound pad stuck on to cover the gash she had got from Frank's handiwork, and Brun had been asked to apply constant pressure while they drove making ignoring why Trouble's shirt was stained a lot harder.

Next to Trouble was the a paramedic, with sea legs a crab fisher would envy, doing impressive work filling Debug's arms with IV lines. Brun had been avoiding looking at Dee for most of the drive so far, her heart twisting any time she glanced and saw the seemingly unstoppable woman brought low. Dee had, in her mind, been the one thing that was beyond everyone's reach, either through her skittishness or what she now knew as paranoia rather than preparedness. But now, she was in some kind of restraint around her hips and legs and had a blanket covering her lower body for modesty since they'd cut her out of her clothes before getting her into the ambulance.

Several of her arguments with Sinéad earlier today had been on what the two of them considered was Debug's idea of safe, all of which had been proven wrong in both directions as neither would have guessed an active construction site. While none of the dumpsters she had suggested had provided the gift of her quarry hiding behind them, Sinéad always had a comment ready to throw in her face about how insecure or exposed the spot was and how Dee would never pick somewhere so thoughtless. Brun was entirely in support of Debug not talking to Sinéad after this was over, they made a poor mother. Someone who felt the need to waste time arguing about being right rather than doing something to help had their priorities backwards.

"Trouble, I need you to pull through this." Brun whispered, the wail of the ambulance's sirens mostly drowning her out so she didn't expect Trouble to hear her, this was more for her own benefit. "I need to tell you how much you mean to me. I need you to be here tomorrow so I can tell you I love you. And I need you to kick my ass so I can tell Debug too, cause I'm still a bit scared of her."

"I can do that..." Trouble's quiet voice responded, though Brun pressing on her probably made it harder. "...but I don't think the doctors will let me kick anyone for a while." The fragile creature tried to smile up at Brun who burst into tears in response, Brun very much wanted to give her another kiss. Ever since she'd stepped across that threshold the previous night, every time she saw Trouble she wanted to hold her even closer, to reaffirm her love for them with more affection than before.

Brun had been sure that seeing Trouble slowly healing from her injuries had desensitized to serious injury, she had been sure helping the nurses tally all Trouble's injuries and listening to them speculate on how she got them had desensitized her to thinking about the moment her friend had been hurt. But half standing in the back of an ambulance, guilt ridden that she could have stopped both of the women she loved from getting this injured, Brun felt alone and terrified she had missed every opportunity to make sure her friends knew how much for loved and cherished them.

Felicity woke groggily, like rising out of a puddle of relaxing mud that at all times wanted to reclaim her. 

The first thing she saw was her knight and protector fighting off a doctor.

"I'll rest when I know they're going to pull through! I won't do anything except stay by their side and that's final. Now it's been half an hour so I'm going to see Dee cause I think Dr Henderson said he'd be round for a checkup about now." Brun seethed as she stalked away, Trouble was sure if this wasn't a hospital Brun would be stomping and knocking things over.

The doctor watched Brun storm off quietly shaking her head before turning back to look at Trouble and noticed she was awake.

"Ohh, great. Miss Brown wouldn't actually tell me what your name was. She kept saying to check her own medical file. Do you remember your name?" The doctor did their best to not loom over Trouble, but when she was trapped in a bed and drugged to the gills it was difficult not to.

"Trouble." Trouble answered. 

"...n-no...I known you're on some powerful pain killers, but if we could have a name? You weren't found with your wallet, so we don't have any ID to go off of, and I am suspicious Miss Brown doesn't know your name." The doctor looked a little flustered and frustrated, but so was Trouble, she had just told her was her name was. And she did have her wallet, it was in her pants pocket. Trouble looked down at her pants to try to prove her point, but she couldn't see her legs since she was covered in blankets.

"I'm wearing a blanket." Trouble said matter-of-factly as thought that would explain her point. 

"How do you know Miss Brown?" The doctor seemed more exasperated as time was going on. 

"I love her." Trouble answered. An oddly tense silence held over the room, Trouble noticed someone dashing and amazing was in the doorway looking sheepish.

"Her name is Felicity Harbour, I've got her Medicare number here too. I told you we wrote it down in my medical record last time she was here." Brun looked like she had run a very long way with how flushed her face was, but the nurse's station was only a few metres away as far as Toruble could see out the gap in the curtains. "She was being stalked by someone with ties to the police so we wanted to make sure you lot didn't accidentally dox her."

Trouble couldn't work out why Brun wouldn't meet here eyes.
