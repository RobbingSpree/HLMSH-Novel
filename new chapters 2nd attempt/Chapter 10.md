Trouble awoke and struggled to rise, delicately retrieving her arms and body from the grip of the women around her.

She didn't know how much time had passed, but she rarely spelt longer than a few hours. 

Taking her time to crawl down and out the bottom of the bed. She didn't know how much weight she could put on her broken arm, and didn't want to test it. As such, she felt like she moved at a glacial pace. 

Once free of the bed Trouble took stoke of the room. The clothes Brun and Debug had brought were all in a messy pile in a shelf of the wardrobe, nearby was a manilla folder she didn't recognize that when opening she found all her important documents. Over on the countertop near the kitchenette she found her laptop, drawing tablet and what looked like every cable and accessory that was at her desk.

Grabbing the laptop, she scanned the room looking for a comfortable spot to sit down and start her work day.

The spoiled part of her heart that Brun and Debug's presence had nurtured wanted to sit back in bed between the two sleeping women. But so much of her instincts were telling her she needed to give them space and not bother them.

Setting a work spot aside, she did need a fresh outfit. She was confident if she changed here Brun wouldn't wake up and spy her, she looked more tired last night than the night prior and was difficult to wake then. On the other hand, Debug. Did she want to be seen while getting changed? Was that why she was still standing in plain view holding the clothes? She wasn't making any effort to go to the ensuite and get some privacy. 

Rather than stand frozen and analyze herself, Trouble just assumed everyone would stay asleep and it wouldn't matter where she chose to get dressed. Fleeting fantasies of being desired or caressed or kissed again were wasting time. 

She stripped off her shirt, noting several blood stains and spots where it had been torn down the side she hadn't seen before. Reaching to where on her side that injury would have been she found one of her several fresh bandages. The padded cloth felt rough to the touch, as much as she had liked actually being fussed over at the hospital, she was dreading having to take off all the tape that held the bandages on. She could deal with pain when it had already happened, she had far too much experience at that. But causing herself pain was something she struggled with. 

Turning to look back at her bed full of kind women, Trouble wondered if it would be a step too far to ask one of them for help getting the bandages off her. Debug had seemed quite knowledgeable in what to do with the hospital, maybe they had some experience with caring for injuries.

Trouble walked over to the bedside to look at Debug closer. She recalled the previous night - or earlier this morning since they had done the break in just before dawn - Debug crying in their sleep. She wondered what someone as confident as them would have that haunted their dreams. They had gone to sleep in a button up shirt with their sleeves rolled up and ill fitting dress pants. Compared to Brun, who's uniform made her look like a stylish professional, Debug looked like she was trying to look foolish. While they lay on their side, Trouble looked at their loose arm that had flopped behind their back. Their skin was absolutely covered in freckles, unlike what her own pale skin implied, Debug must have spent a lot of time outside.

Something in the low light caught Trouble's eye. A bright patch of skin amongst the flowerbed of freckles. A scar. And as she moved closer to inspect it, she saw more. All the way up the inside of Debug's arm, from their elbow and disappearing into their sleeve, scar after scar. Short lines that drew across their skin, some deeper and more serious than others. None of them looked fresh, and Trouble had to stop themselves from touching them.

Looking down at their own bare chest and the hodge-podge of bandages and plasters covering her skin, she wondered again if she was broken beyond fixing. She then remembered she wasn't wearing a shirt and had gotten distracted from the matter at hand.

Trouble snuck back over to the wardrobe and put on a shelf bra shirt, before swapping her underwear for fresh ones and pants for shorts. With her legs visible now she could see even more of the bandages on her skin. She still didn't want to remove any of them, but the itch of the adhesive pulling faintly at her skin was hard to ignore. Rather than try to argue with herself about how far she should stay from her friends again, she climbed back into the bed and sat between her two guardians. Opened her laptop to discover the time wasn't too late in the morning and tried to get to work.

Mere minutes after getting started, with her laptop propped up between her bare legs and stomach, Trouble was distracted by her bedfellows moving and settling again in their sleep. From this side she could see the dried streaks from Debug's tears on their face, without her arm they seemed to have grabbed a chunk of the blanket and was holding that close to their chest. Trouble found her eyes drawn to Debug's lips.

"It was a nice kiss..." Trouble lamented thinking back to their embrace in the reception. "...am I gay?" She turned to ask Brun's sleeping body. 

With a bit of sunlight coming through around the edge of the blinds she could see that Brun wasn't wearing as much of her uniform as Debug. They wore just a singlet that clung to their body and trousers that showed off their bum. Trouble found herself not knowing where to look, Brun's toned arms or gently rising and falling bust or at the hands that had held her so warmly before.

"Oh no...I am gay. This explains...nothing, huh." Trouble tried to recall if she had similar feelings when she was younger, but all that came to mind was making sure no one else her age went anywhere near her dad for fear of what they might do to other kids. "I did always enjoy watching the Volleyball when the big sports things were on TV. So maybe there were signs." She muttered to herself.

Looking at Brun again in this new light, they were quite beautiful. the delicate lines from their collarbones and neck that lead to their kind face. While gazing at her friend, Trouble was struck by the thought that if the reason Debug was as keen to help was because they had similar hurt in their past, what could have happened to Brun to make them as kind and gentle as they were.

Realizing she was avoiding work, Trouble shifted and tried to refocus. Only to immediately turn to look at Debug, wondering if now that she was aware she was gay she could work out why she had found their kiss to be so electric. They were about the same height and build and had similar pale skin tones, and since Trouble had never found herself attractive it was unlikely that was what had made their embrace so wonderful. Maybe it had just been the ease at which their reassurance had turned passionate?

Simple conjecture was unlikely to get an answer. 

Since that kiss had been so good at helping them get through their panic and worry, perhaps she could ask Debug for more kisses to help stay calm in the future. With obviously no untoward desires in the mix, it would be...akin to an experiment.

Debug awoke and felt scuffed, like she had been bent out of shape or drop out of a window.

Taking in her surroundings and recalling the circumstances that lead to her current predicament, she realized it was the bed that had done her in. The few times she'd taken Manager Beth up on spending the night at the hotel rather than trudging home she had woken up in pain every time. The mattresses they used throughout the hotel were much too soft for Debug's tastes.
