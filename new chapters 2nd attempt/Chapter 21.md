Debug couldn't work out how this kept happening. 

The entire reason she had that black book of contacts was cause this kept happening. She thought she must just have a face that screamed 'pester me when I'm alone' cause it had been almost relaxing spending time with Trouble and not being acosted like this.

But without Brun coming to check on her ever half hour, she probably had that look, and one of the nurses had seen it and acted. And now here she was: learning to knit with a nurse at the end of her shift. 

Bonnie, as she had introduced herself (much to the agreement of her name tag), sat on the side of Debug's hospital bed holding the ball of yarn and making encouraging noises while Debug struggled.

"So the other nurses were saying you were dating the tall glass of chocolate milk that kept visiting you, but she's also dating another patient. Was she two timing you and you two got into a fight? Did you...lose?" Debug tried to put down the knitting and watched as the last few minutes of work was undone as one needle slipped from her hand and fell entirely out of the tangle of knots. Debug frowned at it before considering it for the best that this mess be undone and she start over.

"We didn't fight. As far as I know, I woke up here and Trouble was saying I saved her from her abusive ex." Debug was not comfortable with the nurses gossiping about her this much, least of all of they told her about it. "Can you help me start again? I think I'm getting the hang of this." Debug was lying, she felt like knitting was akin to dancing while incredibly drunk and unable to remember the steps. She kept feeling like she had a job to do and didn't know what step she was up to any time she paused for too long. 

Whereas learning to pick locks had made her feel blind, knitting made her feel lost. 

"I'm not dating either of Brun or Trouble." Debug finished, trying to set the record as dull as possible so the nurses would get bored and find a new subject to focus on.

"So you're single?" Something about Bonnie's voice told her she had said was the wrong choice to dissuade attention. Why would they be happy if she was single? That was a much less interesting story to gossip about. Debug concluded that they must have a betting pool for what was actually going on, and her confirmation was what Bonnie had bet on. And since they were nice, she decided to validate their assumption.

"Yeah, I've not dated anyone for a while." Debug knew this was a lie, but she didn't think going on dates with Trouble counted if Trouble didn't have romantic feelings for her...or did they? Debug did have a hazy memory of Brun and Trouble...or someone who looked or sounded like them pronouncing their love for her...but that sounded more like a dream she had while running dry on blood than something that would actually happen to her. 

Bonnie scooted further up the bed, dropping the guard on the side that stopped Debug from rolling out so she could get as far up as possible. 

"Here, let me show you how it's done again. It's cute how clumsy you are at this." Bonnie reached out to take Debug's hands with her own.

Trouble had been overly affectionate when they had visited, but had kept a solid meter or so of distance from her at all times, like she was overreacting to something the nurses had said about infection risks or something. It might have had something to do with Brun being present, who had gone from keeping Trouble close to actively petting her at all times. It wasn't hard to see why the nurses had been gossiping about them. 

In this moment Debug was a lot more thankful of how Trouble had given her space, cause as soon as Bonnie took Debug's hands she felt a cold sweat break out over her body. The dull ache that was her entire lower body started to feel like it was being pricked and torn, and all strength felt like it left her arms. Debug realised she wasn't looking with her eyes and felt like she understood the space she was in as though someone was describing it to her poorly.

She didn't know how long it had been but she became aware that Bonnie was attaching another IV lines to her and the room had become very loud.

"Her heart rate just spiked and then dropped through the floor, is the infection back?" Bonnie sounded very distraught, the knitting still lay in Debug's lap half dismantled. "Wait...she's coming good? Miss Nolanam? Are you okay?" The nurses had given Debug every possible variation of how to pronounce her surname, she wasn't going to correct them until someone guessed the correct way. Bonnie was starting to give her the same space that Trouble had been giving her all week.

"I think...I'm allergic to girls."

Felicity was not doing well. Even that was over selling how well she was dealing with the current situation.

At all times she felt like she needed to scream and burst into tears. Nowhere felt safe, not even in Brun's arms, which is where she currently was. She had actually been spending a lot of her days this week in Brun's arms. First they had told her Debug didn't think of what they had was special, which honestly had made her feel like she had died. All her past relationships had been very clear when things changed and she wasn't considered special or beautiful anymore, but she hadn't gotten that sense at all from Debug. But her rollercoaster didn't stop there, Brun had seemingly out of nowhere decided that she was worth giving more affection to, and they had shared a wonderful kiss while she was half asleep. But it didn't end there...or did it? Felicity couldn't really think about anything that happened after that that wasn't violent flashes of very strong emotions. 

She knew something had happened, and if she pushed herself again she could probably explain it to the police again. But right now, sitting next to Brun on a bus, the noise of everything washing over her like standing in the shallows of the ocean, everything seemingly trying to push and pull her in all directions. Her only rock and safety at the moment was her beautiful and tall protector. Brun seemed unphased by everything
