She had been wrong. Trouble had been very wrong. There was apparently still a limit to how much she could keep under wraps.

About when Bug had started putting lip gloss on her it tipped from being overwhelming in a fun and exciting way to overwhelming in a scary way.

All of her senses started feeling a little off, like they had slipped off the mark and landed somewhere several meters away. It felt like she was being being given a play by play of what was going on by someone nearby.

Her normal technique of forcing control over her breathing, and by extension herself, didn't work as she had forgotten how to directly control any of her muscles. The overwhelming sensations had scrambled her control. Her body would tell her something had happened and if she wanted to tell it something back it simply didn't respond.

She could feel through her skin that someone had tried talking to her, but since she couldn't tell what they were saying, having misplaced where her ears lead to, she just had to guess and say she was excited to finally go back outside again.

Thankfully, whoever was around to help didn't ask any further questions and just helped them rinse out the dye from her hair and get dry. Then for some reason helped her put on socks and shoes and lead them by the hand out the door.

Since they didn't feel like they were looking through their own eyes, walking through the hotel's corridors felt more like navigating through their own memories or a dream.

When they made it outside and suddenly into strong winds, the incredible noise felt like it made them scream. But since their companion didn't seem to react at all, they must not have acted on that. Just in case she tried to scream again and couldn't hear or feel anything beyond the lash and pull of the wind on her skin.

But that did raise the question if they were talking aloud at all. Were they saying any of the things they were thinking.

Having now got on a bus, Trouble could feel the noise of the engine in her bones.

She was sitting on a seat, it felt like it was covered in carpet the long fibers pulled taught by her presence, to one side was the window and the other side a person sat keeping her from leaving.

Trouble couldn't recognize the person sitting next to her, but also couldn't recognize herself.

She tried to lift up their hand and touch their own face, but nothing happened.

Slowly, they felt the response.

Their hand was too heavy, their fingers were tangled in something, attempting to pull it away was resisted somehow.

***

Debug was even more confused, the last hour had confirmed nothing and had actively made everything less clear.

She had been doing Trouble's make up, covering up all their bruises with what looked like a good match for their complexion and had finished it off with lip gloss to cover some mild scars.

She had been doing her best to not come to any conclusions about Trouble's injuries, but she recognizes these injuries as likely being from someone slapping them while wearing jewelry. She mentally stomped on the surfacing memory of caring for the other kids when there was a moment of quiet and comparing notes about how best to hide one another's injuries.

Trouble had seemed like they'd been enjoying being pampered for once, but when she went to finish the job they had gone suddenly quiet.

No more happy noises of enjoyment they didn't seem to notice they were making. No more wriggling in their seat and not knowing what to do with their hands. It was as though a librarian had snuck in and had aggressively shushed them while she wasn't looking.

Worried touching their lips carelessly had brought up uncomfortable memories they quickly started packing up and went to grab some tissue to clean up any errant product they'd used. When they returned Trouble was muttering, just under their breath, and seemed a little out of it.

"You ready to jet?" Debug had asked. Not sure how she should handle Trouble if they were having an episode like the first day they'd met, Brun had been the one to handle all that after all.

"I'm excited to go outside again." Was their response, which wasn't that unusual, but it wasn't how they normally responded to questions. Their voice was louder than normal, projecting to fill the room rather than just spoken to who she was talking to.

Possibly against their better judgement, Debug had put shoes and socks on Trouble and then taken their hand to lead them out of the room like they'd seen Brun do many times before.

She had tried asking Trouble some follow up questions as they walked, talking quietly so as not too seem suspicious. But all they got in response was more quiet muttering. Yet they could walk normally through the hotel without issue.

So they hesitantly traveled on.

Once they got outside: Trouble suddenly started screaming and Debug almost let go of their hand.

It took a moment for more muttering, much louder now to fill Debug in.

"The wind is so loud on my skin." They repeated several times. Which gave Debug more clues, but ultimately answered nothing. It was clearly some kind of dissociative episode and while she felt the right thing to do was not leave Trouble cooped up in their room she had no better ideas on how to help ground them.

Up until now and except for their first, all of their kisses had been something Trouble asked for.

She couldn't in good conscience try to give them one now to help ground them when they were seemingly unable to acknowledge their surroundings or control what they said and what they kept to themselves. And foolishly, she'd not tried pursuing anything else that might work as a grounding ritual in the last few weeks.

That would have to be something they worked toward after today.

They'd needed help to make the step into the bus, but once lead to a seat they easily sat down. When they had sat down they briefly let go of their hand to change how they held, only for Trouble to aggressively seek them back out and entwine their fingers together.

It was an all together odd but not unpleasant bus ride.

But as they got off the bus again and Debug lead them through the car park to the still glowing lights of the big box store, wind still blowing and buffeting them they seemed to come back to the present more. The wind was warm and comfortable, despite trying to blind her with dust if she looked back to see how Trouble was doing.

"Watch the step here." Debug yelled back through the gale, pointing with their free hand and noticing Trouble look where they pointed. "We're almost inside."

Trouble made an affirmative noise in response carried by the wind trying to push them into the shop.

Stumbling inside, she lead her duckling off to the side into the home appliances section. Finding a corner with a bare wall, she shuffled Trouble such their back was against the wall and tried to force them to meet her gaze.

"Black Swan, you with me? You've been a bit scattered since I did your make up. You okay we made it here?" Trying to not take up much space nor draw attention to their gathering in the corner, Debug stood quite close she could feel the hint of breath from Trouble on her cheek.

The many intimate moments they'd spent together had worn down the distance she felt she needed to keep Trouble at when calm, and with them as vulnerable as they currently seemed that distance shrunk further.

"Actually, you've not seen what you look like with your new hair colour yet, have you?" They ran a hand through Trouble's short and now deep, dark blue hair.

It took a moment before she realized this was the same sort of move she'd seen Brun do a dozen times to Trouble; and began wondering if Brun knew how easily such actions would make a short lesbian like her heart flutter with excitement and if she could keep a straight face if they got any ideas to try and extend the same physical intimacy to her.

Trouble would be fine with something like that from herself, they obviously didn't swing that way. Further evident by them shutting their eyes tightly and looking pained.

Debug gave them space again, waiting for them to open their eyes again.

Kicking themself mentally for hoping Trouble only looked pained due to actual pain and not repulsion from their touch.

"Let's go check out the ladies section and see what bargains we can find." They said leading the way.

***

Trouble felt both like she was in a dream and that things were far too real.

Walking through the car park had been very grounding, focusing on all the sensations of the wind pushing her and her hand in Bug's had been very reassuring. She recognized the feeling of her mind fitting back in her own body again as the same as many times they'd shared a gentle kiss to break her anxiety.

When they had gotten inside and Debug had pushed her against the wall, Trouble could only think this was it.

That she had somehow let slip that she felt more than respect for their friend, that they might need to wear some of the clothes they would buy out of the store.

Especially fresh underwear.

They'd closed their eyes, expecting the next thing they would feel would be the familiar gentleness of lips pressed against lips and the same hunger that filled her daydreams of when they had first shared a kiss.

But instead Debug teased her.

They had gotten close enough she could feel their breath on her skin, the hairs on her arms stood up in anticipation. What felt like an urge from deep in her stomach wanting to reach out and pull Bug close, have them leave their entire body weight against her.

But instead of kissing Trouble, they had run a hand through her hair and complimented their new look.

Before walking off and leaving her unsatisfied.

Now minutes later, standing amongst the shirts and tops, they couldn't think of anything that wasn't Bug's hands on their body.

Not helping in this matter, Bug kept on bringing clothes up to them, pressing the garment against them, letting skin touch skin with their hands against her bare shoulder. Trouble had never been much of a physical affection person before, but this felt like a step beyond teasing.

A hunger she didn't know was real had awoken in her; and here was her friend taunting her with a taste, tantalizing her even.

"Yeah, I think this would look good on you. Do you like how it feels?" Bug once again came close enough to grab to taunt her, holding a shirt up in a fist to gently lean against her cheeks. The urge to simply lean into that touch, to grab their hand and hold it close, to return the gesture.

It felt unfair that she was the only one affected by this.

"Actually..." Trouble interrupted, blindly grabbing a garment off the rack. "I think you'd look cute in this. I've got enough to try on a few, do you wanna come with me to the change rooms and we'll give it a go? See if it fits." Trouble had no plan, but if she could put the idea of herself taking off clothes into Bug's mind they might be on even footing.

"Sure, that looks comfy. I think there's a giant sign on the wall saying the change rooms are over there." They said pointing behind them, seemingly unfazed. "We don't have unlimited time so we should start making some choices in case they give us a time limit soon."

Bug took her hand again and lead her off.

Both Bug and Brun seemed to think she needed to be lead everywhere by the hand, and while she did enjoy it it constantly put her on the back foot in terms of getting the attention she wanted.

Upon reaching the change rooms they found the old lady who managed it talking to someone in a construction vest.

"I'll go take my dinner break and be back in twenty to finish this, okay Ruth?" The old lady waved him away and beckoned the pair closer. As they approached they saw that the dressing rooms had been disassembled and were in utter disarray.

"Don't worry, Love." The lady Trouble had to assume was called Ruth said. "There's still the one big one at the end. You two are sisters, yes? Just go in together darlings, there's no rule against going in together." While the pair looked puzzled at one another Ruth spared no time and started prodding them towards the change room together.

With a few more steps and Ruth dramatically closing the curtain behind them Trouble felt entirely trapped. Now in the confined space together, and with Ruth having got out of earshot, Trouble turned to her companion.

"We look like sisters?" She asked, genuinely confused.

"Well...here come stand next to me and look in the mirror." Debug said, beckoning them closer.

Trouble stepped next to her friend, again noting how similar in height and build they were. Debug had a bit more muscle on her, with legs that looked lean and capable and arms that had a shape to them beyond skeletal. Looking in the mirror, Trouble gasped.

She saw, two women with similar shaped and coloured eyes, the same mussed up dark with a sheen of blue hair, the same height, and very similar skin tones.

Bug had a multitude more freckles, a gentle progression of spots that covered her nose, cheeks, forehead and ran down her neck. Those same freckles sprouted everywhere she had bare skin. The colour Trouble was used to seeing on herself, all her bruises, were gone. Politely hidden under her makeup.

When she looked at Bug she saw a beautiful woman, confident and defiant. Somehow, any time she had gone to her friend with a problem they had a solution from the word go, that confidence and capability was something she very much envied. They didn't look how actors looked beautiful, but there was something about them, something she trusted, that shone like light to her. And next to them looked someone who must be beautiful too, by association she must be.

"That's me?" She asked in disbelief, running a hand through her hair and watching the reflection copy her movements..

"Yeah, I told you I thought the colour would look good on you." They said, playfully mussing up Trouble's hair further, though the wind had already done a number on it.

"But I'm..." She paused, unsure what word would even be appropriate to use. Before panicking and blurting out whatever was left in their mouth. "...Pretty."

"You're cute as a button. There's a reason Brun fauns over you so. They like small cute things, and you're cute."

Trouble felt entirely lost. She had planned to make Bug more aware of her appearance even if she didn't have much to flaunt. But...

But this was too much.

A familiar sensation of overwhelming emotion bubbled up, but rather than the overwhelming fear that normally came with it, Trouble felt relieved.

She had been wrong this whole time.

She wasn't disgusting to look at or inherently flawed in a way everyone else but she could see.

She tried holding back the tears to not ruin her makeup, Debug just walked over and held her and let her cry into their shoulder.
