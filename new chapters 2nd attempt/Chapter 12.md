She had been wrong. Trouble had been very wrong. There was apparently still a limit to how much she could keep under wraps.

About when Bug had started putting lip gloss on her it tipped from being overwhelming in a fun and exciting way to overwhelming in a scary way. All of her senses started feeling a little off, like they had slipped off the mark and landed somewhere several meters away. Her normal technique of forcing control over her breathing, and by extension herself, didn't work as she had forgotten how to directly control any of her muscles.

Someone had tried talking to her, but since she couldn't tell what they were saying, having misplaced where her ears lead to, she just had to guess and say she was excited to finally go back outside again.

Thankfully, whoever was around to help didn't ask any further questions and just helped them rinse out the dye from her hair and get dry. Then for some reason helped her put on socks and shoes and lead them by the hand out the door.

Since they didn't feel like they were looking through their own eyes, walking through the hotel's corridors felt more like navigating through their own memories or a dream. When they made it outside and suddenly into strong winds, the incredible noise felt like it made them scream. But since their companion didn't seem to react at all, they must not have acted on it.

But that did raise the question if they were talking aloud at all. Were they saying any of the things they were thinking. Having now got on a bus, Trouble could feel the noise of the engine in her skin. She was sitting on a seat, it felt like it was covered in carpet, to one side was the window and the other side a person sat keeping her from leaving.

Trouble couldn't recognize the person sitting next to her, but also couldn't recognize herself. They tried to lift up their hand and touch their own face, but nothing happened. Slowly, they felt the response. Their hand was too heavy, their fingers were tangled in something, attempting to pull it away was resisted somehow.

Debug was even more confused, the last hour had confirmed nothing and had actively made everything less clear.

She had been doing Trouble's make up, covering up all their bruises with what looked like a good match for their complexation and had finished it off with lip gloss. They had seemed like they'd been enjoying being pampered for once, but when she went to finish the job they had gone suddenly quiet.

No more happy noises of enjoyment they didn't seem to notice they were making. No more wriggling in their seat and not knowing what to do with their hands. It was as though a librarian had snuck in and had aggressively shushed them while she wasn't looking. 

Worried touching their lips carelessly had brought up uncomfortable memories they quickly started packing up and went to grab some tissue to clean up any errant product they'd used. When they returned Trouble was muttering, just under their breath, and seemed a little out of it.

"You ready to jet?" Debug had asked. Not sure how she should handle Trouble if they were having an episode like the first day they'd met.

"I'm excited to go outside again." Was their response, which wasn't that unusual, but it wasn't how they normally responded to questions. 

Possibly against their better judgement, Debug had taken Trouble's hand and lead them out of the room like they'd seen Brun do many times before.

She had tried asking Trouble some follow up questions as they walked, talking quietly so as not too seem threatening. But all they got in response was more quiet muttering. Yet they could walk normally through the hotel without issue.

So they hesitantly traveled on. Once they got outside: Trouble suddenly screamed and Debug almost let go of their hand. It took a moment for more muttering, much louder now to fill Debug in.

"The wind is so loud on my skin." They repeated several times. Which gave Debug more clues, but ultimately answered nothing. It was clearly some kind of dissociative episode and while she felt the right thing to do was not leave Trouble cooped up in their room she had no better ideas on how to help ground them.

Up until now and except for their first, all of their kisses had been something Trouble asked for. She couldn't in good conscience try to give them one now to help ground them when they were seemingly unable to acknowledge their surroundings or control what they said and what they kept to themselves. And foolishly, she'd not tried pursuing anything else that might work as a grounding ritual.

They'd needed help to make the step into the bus, but once lead to a seat they easily sat down. When they had sat down they briefly let go of their hand to change how they held, only for Trouble to aggressively seek them back out and entwine their fingers together. 

It was an all together odd bus ride. But as they got off the bus again and Debug lead them through the car park to the still glowing lights of the big box store, wind still blowing and buffeting them they seemed to come back to the present more. The wind was warm and comfortable, despite trying to blind her with dust if she looked back to see how Trouble was doing.

"Watch the step here." Debug yelled back through the gale, pointing with their free hand and noticing Trouble look where they pointed. "We're almost inside."

Trouble made an affirmative noise in response carried by the wind trying to push them into the shop.

Stumbling inside, she lead her duckling off to the side into the home appliances section. Finding a corner with a bare wall, she shuffled Trouble such their back was against the wall and tried to force them to meet her gaze.

"Black Swan, you with me? You've been a bit scattered since I did your make up. You ok we made it here?" Trying to not take up much space nor draw attention to their gathering in the corner, Debug stood quite close. The many intimate moments they'd spent together had worn down the distance she felt she needed to keep Trouble at. "Actually, you've not seen what you look like with your new hair colour yet, have you?" They ran a hand through Trouble's short and now deep dark blue hair, before realizing this was the same sort of move she'd seen Brun do and began wondering if Brun knew how easily such actions would make a short lesbian's heart flutter.

Trouble would be fine with something like that from herself, she obviously didn't swing that way. Further evident by them shutting their eyes tightly and looking pained. Debug gave them space again, waiting for them to open their eyes again. Kicking themself mentally for hoping Trouble only looked pained due to actual pain and not repulsion from their touch.

"Let's go check out the ladies section and see what bargains we can find." They said leading the way.

Trouble felt both like she was in a dream and that things were too real.

Walking through the car park had been very grounding, focusing on all the sensations of the wind pulling at her and her hand in Bug's had been very reassuring. She recognized the same feeling of fitting her own body again as the many times they'd shared a gentle kiss.

When they had gotten inside and pushed her against the wall, Trouble could only think this was it. That she had somehow let slip that she felt more than respect for their friend, that they might need to wear some of the clothes they would buy out of the store. Especially fresh underwear.

They'd closed their eyes, expecting the next thing they would feel would be the familiar gentleness of lips pressed against lips. Of the same hunger that filled her daydreams of when they had first shared a kiss.

But instead they'd teased her. Gotten close enough she could feel their breath on her skin, and instead of kissing Trouble, they had run a hand through her hair and complimented their new look. Before walking off and leaving them unsatisfied.

Now minutes later, standing amongst the shirts and tops, they couldn't think of anything that wasn't Bug's hands on their body. Not helping in this matter, Bug kept on bringing clothes up to them, pressing the garment against them, letting skin touch skin with their hands against her bare shoulder.
