Trouble let Bug break their kiss, and this time their legs stayed steady under them and didn't buckle.

They had been staying at the hotel for two weeks now and had lost count of how many kisses they had asked Debug for. Thankfully, they were polite enough to oblige Trouble's wants. She had started asking for them to help her deal with anxiety when it got too difficult to ignore, but it was becoming difficult to pretend she wasn't also very much enjoying these kisses. 

What had started as unfathomable excitement and joy had simmered down to an incredible thrill. She did occasionally have the overwhelming notion that there was more people did beyond kissing, but if a kiss still made her knees weak: she wasn't ready for any heavier petting.

"I don't want to say you're getting better at this, Trouble." Bug said, still cupping her cheeks in their hands. "But this therapy seems to be working, cause you're not in tears when we stop anymore. I've still got two hours left of my shift, so come find me or give me a call if anything comes up or you need to vent." With a wave they left back out into the hall, closing Trouble's room door behind them.

Venting had been their other major breakthrough. For her entire life, Felicity had been trying to keep her problems and difficulties secret. Whether it be losing her mother and younger sister at an early age, her dad's spiral into alcohol thereafter, their being unable to deal with the loss and taking it out on her, her old boss stealing her wage, the fact her dad had somehow been part of that scheme too, and all the stuff with Frank. Being able to talk to someone about that sort of stuff, someone who understood and didn't judge her. Just getting that out of her mouth and being able to say that it happened lifted a weight from her she didn't know she had been carrying. 

That and Frank seemingly having not looked for her at the hotel since Debug first spotted them had let her unwind and relax and enjoy the kisses she was getting.

The kisses were one of the highlights of her day.

In the last week she had managed to establish a reliable routine most days of the week, following Brun and Debug's schedule. She would wake up late in the morning, and if it was a weekday she would do her own job. During the day when they had time, Bug would drop by and check on them. While they had essentially swapped one prison for another, as Trouble didn't feel safe leaving the hotel, she had a lot further to wander and more people to talk to. If the day was going poorly, and recently even if it had been going well, she would ask Bug for a 'Treat' and be rewarded for her honesty. Then once their shift ended both her and Bug would be free to and spend some time lounging about in Trouble's room. This would be when she worked up the courage to vent and talk about her past. Once Brun's shift had properly started, they'd come by too, and if Bug had stuck around, they'd all eat dinner together. Then if Brun had tasks that involved a lot of walking around the hotel, they'd come and collect Trouble from her room and they'd chat as they worked. At some point late at night Trouble would retire back to their room and the whole schedule would repeat.

Trouble hadn't thought that all it would take to feel safe was two people caring about her, she couldn't argue with the results.

One thing she currently didn't have the confidence to do though, was ask Bug and Brun for another sleepover. That had really been the turning point in her recovery, and she was confident that if she got several more of those: that would fix her. All the myriad problems wrong with her, just several restful nights in the arms of her favorite people would absolve her of her flaws.

One of those myriad flaws was looking at her from the wardrobe: her clothes situation. She still only had two complete outfits. And while it was possible for her clothes to be washed and dried here by either Bug or Brun, she didn't like how it made her appear she wasn't self-sufficient at all. It didn't help that she didn't help with her meals and had two people looking after her day and night.

So while she couldn't do anything to rely on Bug and Brun less, she could take steps so they'd have to help less often. Which in this problem meant she needed more clothes.

One of the first things Debug had helped her to do after they woke up two Monday's ago was open a new bank account that Frank didn't know about, and her wage had finally appeared in it so all she needed to do now was find a way to leave the hotel and feel safe enough to window shop. Debug had also said for the tie being she wasn't allowed to shop online, and she couldn't stay here forever so it was a good an excuse as any to find a way to disguise herself.

Trouble pulled her work laptop back out and started to research disguises and what shops were in town.

Debug felt out of place walking the halls of her workplace in her casual clothes.

Before meeting Trouble, as soon as they finished their handover Debug would be out the door and heading home while still in their work clothes. But now, they were spending a good chunk of their free time still at work, just so they could spend more time with Trouble and Brun.

In the last two weeks their supply of clothes they kept at the hotel had tripled. What used to be an emergency garment and some socks was now two whole outfits, and it wasn't just her normal casual clothes that made her body shape entirely ambiguous, but instead it was nice clothes that showed off her rear and shoulders. She wasn't trying to show off, but she did worry what her normal relaxing clothes said about her to people who did care she existed.

It was difficult to shake the old habits of wearing clothes that made her difficult to describe or identify, but if the same clothes made her feel bad seeing her own reflection they might have the same effect on other people looking at her too. And while she kept telling herself that the kisses she was sharing with Trouble meant nothing to them and was just a more gentle version of a clarifying slap to draw their focus. It was very difficult to not get a little worked up.

She stood in front of Troubles door, centering herself. They had only just given them a 'treat' a few hours ago, expecting anything like that was foolish. She knocked and waited for a response, feeling the floor shift very slightly as Trouble's weight joined her near the door.

"Bug!" Trouble's voice came through the door, before the floor shifted slightly again and the door opened inward. "I thought you were going to head home once you finished today. You said you were looking forward to having Friday to yourself." 

"When keeping a hermit, you've gotta make sure they're doing well and not inventing new forms of heresy. I love heresy, don't cut me out of that." She said as she strolled into their room. Over the last few weeks they'd not managed to make the room their own space, never leaving or buying anything certainly made that difficult. Part of why she had dropped by this afternoon was to see if she could find out how Trouble liked to decorate a space so she could bring them a gift on Saturday.

"Actually, I wanted to ask you something..." Trouble interrupted their train of thought, a fact Debug didn't enjoy. "You dye your hair, right?"

Debug raised their eyebrows, mildly impressed they had noticed.

"I saw your roots poking through yesterday and I worked it out today. I wanted to ask your help in giving me a disguise." The pieces fit into place quite quickly in Debug's mind. Two whole weeks of being cooped up in the hotel was their breaking point. They wanted to leave, but make themselves harder to spot for anyone who knew them. She would have expected they go to Brun with this sort of request, but if they wanted to use hair dye she had more experience with that. 

"What's the end goal? We aiming to go for a further walk or a relax in the night time air?" Debug pried, trying to not discourage the delicate creature.
