Trouble let Bug break their kiss, and this time their legs stayed steady under them and didn't buckle.

They had been staying at the hotel for two weeks now and had lost count of how many kisses they had asked Debug for. Thankfully, they were polite enough to oblige Trouble's wants. She had started asking for them to help her deal with anxiety when it got too difficult to ignore, but it was becoming difficult to pretend she wasn't also very much enjoying these kisses. 

What had started as unfathomable excitement and joy had simmered down to an incredible thrill. She did occasionally have the overwhelming notion that there was more people did beyond kissing, but if a kiss still made her knees weak: she wasn't ready for any heavier petting.

"I don't want to say you're getting better at this, Trouble." Bug said, still cupping her cheeks in their hands. "But this therapy seems to be working, cause you're not in tears when we stop anymore. I've still got two hours left of my shift, so come find me or give me a call if anything comes up or you need to vent." With a wave they left back out into the hall, closing Trouble's room door behind them.

Venting had been their other major breakthrough. 

For her entire life, Felicity had been trying to keep her problems and difficulties secret. Whether it be losing her mother and younger sister at an early age, her dad's spiral into alcohol thereafter, their being unable to deal with the loss and taking it out on her, her old boss stealing her wage, the fact her dad had somehow been part of that scheme too, and all the stuff with Frank. Being able to talk to someone about that sort of stuff, someone who understood and didn't judge her. Just getting that out of her mouth and being able to say that it happened lifted a weight from her she didn't know she had been carrying. 

That and Frank seemingly having not looked for her at the hotel since Debug first spotted them had let her unwind and relax and enjoy the kisses she was getting.

The kisses were one of the highlights of her day.

In the last week she had managed to establish a reliable routine most days of the week, following Brun and Debug's schedule. She would wake up late in the morning, and if it was a weekday she would do her own job. During the day when they had time, Bug would drop by and check on them. While they had essentially swapped one prison for another, as Trouble didn't feel safe leaving the hotel, she had a lot further to wander and more people to talk to. If the day was going poorly, and recently even if it had been going well, she would ask Bug for a 'Treat' and be rewarded for her honesty. Then once their shift ended both her and Bug would be free to and spend some time lounging about in Trouble's room. This would be when she worked up the courage to vent and talk about her past. Once Brun's shift had properly started, they'd come by too, and if Bug had stuck around, they'd all eat dinner together. Then if Brun had tasks that involved a lot of walking around the hotel, they'd come and collect Trouble from her room and they'd chat as they worked. At some point late at night Trouble would retire back to their room and the whole schedule would repeat.

Trouble hadn't thought that all it would take to feel safe was two people caring about her, but she couldn't argue with the results.

One thing she currently didn't have the confidence to do though, was ask Bug and Brun for another sleepover. That had really been the turning point in her recovery, and she was confident that if she got several more of those: that would fix her. All the myriad problems wrong with her, just several restful nights in the arms of her favorite people would absolve her of her flaws.

One of those myriad flaws was looking at her from the wardrobe: her clothes situation. She still only had two complete outfits. And while it was possible for her clothes to be washed and dried here by either Bug or Brun, she didn't like how it made her appear she wasn't self-sufficient at all. It didn't help that she didn't help with her meals and had two people looking after her day and night.

So while she couldn't do anything to rely on Bug and Brun less, she could take steps so they'd have to help less often. Which, in this problem, meant she needed more clothes.

One of the first things Debug had helped her to do after they woke up two Monday's ago was open a new bank account that Frank didn't know about, and her wage had finally appeared in it so all she needed to do now was find a way to leave the hotel and feel safe enough to window shop. Debug had also said for the time being she wasn't allowed to shop online, and she couldn't stay here forever so it was a good an excuse as any to find a way to disguise herself.

Trouble pulled her work laptop back out and started to research disguises and what shops were in town.

Debug felt out of place walking the halls of her workplace in her casual clothes.

Before meeting Trouble, as soon as they finished their handover Debug would be out the door and heading home while still in their work clothes. But now, they were spending a good chunk of their free time still at work, just so they could spend more time with Trouble and Brun.

In the last two weeks their supply of clothes they kept at the hotel had tripled. What used to be an emergency garment and some socks was now two whole outfits, and it wasn't just her normal casual clothes that made her body shape entirely ambiguous and indescribable, but instead it was nice clothes that showed off her rear and shoulders. She wasn't trying to show off, but she did worry what her normal relaxing clothes said about her to people who did care she existed.

It was difficult to shake the old habits of wearing clothes that made her difficult to describe or identify, but if the same clothes made her feel bad seeing her own reflection, then they might have the same effect on other people looking at her too. And while she kept telling herself that the kisses she was sharing with Trouble meant nothing to them and was just a more gentle version of a clarifying slap to draw their focus. It was very difficult to not get a little worked up.

She stood in front of Troubles door, centering herself. They had only just given them a 'treat' a few hours ago, expecting anything like that was foolish. She knocked and waited for a response, feeling the floor shift very slightly as Trouble's weight joined her near the door.

"Bug!" Trouble's voice came through the door, before the floor shifted slightly again and the door opened inward. "I thought you were going to head home once you finished today. You said you were looking forward to having Friday to yourself." 

"When keeping a hermit, you've gotta make sure they're doing well and not inventing new forms of heresy. I love heresy, don't cut me out of that." She said as she strolled into their room. Over the last few weeks they'd seemingly not managed to make the room their own space, never leaving or buying anything certainly made that difficult. Part of why she had dropped by this afternoon was to see if she could find out how Trouble liked to decorate a space so she could bring them a gift on Saturday.

"Actually, I wanted to ask you something..." Trouble interrupted their train of thought, a fact Debug didn't enjoy. "You dye your hair, right?"

Debug raised their eyebrows, mildly impressed they had noticed.

"I saw your roots poking through yesterday and I worked it out today. I wanted to ask your help in giving me a disguise." The pieces fit into place quite quickly in Debug's mind. Two whole weeks of being cooped up in the hotel was their breaking point. They wanted to leave, but make themselves harder to spot for anyone who knew them. She would have expected they go to Brun with this sort of request, but if they wanted to use hair dye she evidently had more experience with that. 

"What's the end goal? We aiming to go for a further walk or a relax in the night time air?" Debug pried, trying to not discourage the delicate creature.

"I...err...don't think I can keep relying on your and Brun's kindness when it comes to getting my clothes washed. And since my paycheck came through on the new bank account: I actually have some spending money." Trouble looked at their hands, fingers entwining and tumbling as they spoke. "So I wanted to buy some more so I don't need your help every day or two. Or with a disguise I could go find a laundromat and do it myself." Debug recognized the habits of someone who expected the roof to fall on them for asking to breath. She put her hands over the top of Trouble's, preventing them from fidgeting further. She could feel their fingers wriggle in her palm.

"Do you want a colour to match mine? Or something else? Like Brun's colour?" Debug realized after talking her words might be taken as asking which person Trouble liked better rather than asking them to choose between two different shades of black. Trouble's silvery blonde hair, like her own, wouldn't be difficult to get colour to stick. But Blues would help mute her natural colours more than a solid black. Holding her tongue rather than dig a deeper hole, Debug waited for a response.

Trouble ran their hand through their own very short and uneven hair, in the low light it almost shimmered as it caught the light. It was a lot more appealing to look at than her own pale yellows.

"What you've got looks good...can I...try the same?" 

Debug realized she'd been holding her breath. But rather than release it as one big audible sigh, she kept holding it.

"Sure..." She paused to breath quietly out through her nose. "I'll be right back and we can start your disguise. If we hurry, we can sneak out tonight before the shops close and have something cool to show Brun when she's on shift tomorrow." Debug tried to shift focus from herself to Brun, her emotions weighing on her uncomfortably with Trouble's compliment. 

They had barely ventured into Trouble's room, she realized. They'd just discussed this plan in the cramped hallway that lead into the room proper. The walls felt unwelcoming and too close, and the distance between herself and Trouble read as dangerous. She knew Trouble would never use violence, but the urge to stay out of harm's way was difficult to ignore.

Taking extreme care to walk back past Trouble and not seem awkward or let on that she might not be as capable or strong as Trouble believed. Thoughts of their earlier embraces and 'treats' circled in her mind, taunting her with evidence that she very much wasn't.

"I'll see you soon, Bug." Trouble's voice following her into the hallway as the door closed behind her.

Was she actually a very easy lesbian? Just falling for anyone who complimented her and gave her kisses. She felt disgusted with her own weakness and how easily her heart swayed.

Despite her thorny demeanor her footfalls were as quiet as ever as she stalked to the chemist down at the end of the block.

Trouble felt a mix of excitement and nervousness, it had been a long time since she had been able to do anything with her hair on purpose.

Debug had been true to their word on coming back swiftly. She had expected to need to get settled and watch some dull early evening television. But barely ten minutes after they had left they re-appeared, a little flushed in the face holding a bag of supplies.

The room was then transformed, towels spread on the floor around on of the chairs that normally sat snug against the kitchenette counter, a towel around her shoulders to protect her clothes. And Debug had spread out a lot more tubes of stuff than she expected was needed along the countertop.

"Okay! For our first step, we need wet hair to make all this goo flow more easily around your hair. Go pop your head under the tap in the sink and make it wet." Debug announced, their reassuring voice filling the space.

Trouble complied, walking past them to the sink and trying to ignore the smell of sweat that lingered in the air as they busied themselves with the row of tubes. Since realizing she was gay, Trouble had found themselves reveling in their senses a lot more. The feel of the air, the hum of a voice, the scent that followed a movement. What would have before been just another note in a dull space was somehow now a cheering chord that harmonized with her heart.

The water felt like how she imagined a giant tongue lapping at her head would, pressing down lightly and flowing and rushing over her hair. Within moments her hair was soaked. Jingling her head to shake off loose droplets before following with the towel to go from sodden to damp she returned to the chair next to Debug.

Debug was putting on a pair of disposable gloves like the ones they'd handed her two weeks ago when they broke her into her own house. Memories of that day had become more pleasant as the days passed.

"OK, young one. As someone more senior in the ways of follicle tinting, there's one thing we need to remember..." They paused in a way that made it unclear if they expected a guess or not. "Patience. The longer we leave it - up to a point - the stronger the results. And since we want a convincing colour, we'll wait an hour. So you got anything you want to do while we wait?"

Trouble's mind was already filled with thoughts of gentle cuddles and caresses. But knew she couldn't ask for something selfish and decadent as that. 

"Well, we've got a bunch of time to think about that while we work." Bug interrupted her train of thought while walking out of sight behind her and opening the first of many bottles.

Since their first night together, Trouble had frequently thought back to the warm embrace she had found herself in sleeping between her protectors. Remembering the feel of their hands and bodies touching hers. It had been a reassuring memory of gentle physicality. To say she was unprepared for the sensation of someone gently mussing up her hair and running fingers through it over and over would be an understatement.

Trouble had no good memories that involved her hair. Her dad had disliked it for reminding him of those he had lost, and Frank had disliked it when his own had started to fall out and took that frustration out on Felicity.

Compared to that, the sensation of gentle fingertips running through her short hair sent shivers down her spine. The fact she couldn't see what Bug was doing and could trust them to keep her safe gave her butterflies. She squirmed a little in her seat, the fact she was enjoying this so much making her very embarrassed. She both wanted Bug to not stop so they wouldn't see how much of a mess she was turning into and to stop because she might start making mysterious noises if this went on much longer.

Thankfully, she was saved any further embarrassment as Bug finished. The sound of the gloves being taken off signaling that this step was done.

"Stay still for a sec, Love." Bug's low voice spoke quietly right next to her ear. The low tones doing things she didn't want to acknowledge. 

A silent pause strung out, Trouble not sure what she was staying still for or for how long. She felt the hairs on her arm prick up in anticipation and her ears strained to get a hint as to what would come next.

The rustling of plastic broke the silence followed by the feeling of elastic on her skin as Bug put a shower cap over the dye. Trouble let out a sigh that it was something normal.

"OK, now that we've got that waiting, I have a surprise. Since you've still got some of your more identifying bruises, I got some concealer to apply on you while we wait. You can watch some telly while I work, I got pretty good at this from when I wanted to cover up all my freckles." 

Trouble blanched. According to the clock, she had been lost in bliss for only five minutes and was unsure if she could think straight, let alone walk straight. If Bug kept on pampering her for the next hour she might have some sort of accident.

Last week, this sort of problem might have given her a panic attack. But since she was sure that regardless of what happened now she could convince Bug it was just platonic affection and platonic damp underwear, she could keep these feelings bottled up with only a little bit of spill over.
