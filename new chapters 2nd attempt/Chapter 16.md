Brun had been running her mind ragged the last week trying to work out what was wrong with herself. Maybe she just needed to be attacked to see clearly.

Mere moments ago Trouble had been all over her, plastering her with kiss after kiss. But despite how her imagination had said it had been fine. She wasn't scared or worried, if not for her concern about why Trouble had seemed so upset it had felt fun to let them attack her. 

But that made no sense. Even now, if she thought back and imagined her last boyfriend with his toned muscles and big hands, the notion of letting him touch her turned her stomach. But she wasn't opposed to guys, if she imagined Trouble was packing she would have felt the same. 

Putting that aside, she tried to do what Trouble had yelled at her and imagined Debug trying to make a pass at her. This had been part of her problem all week, because Debug was so standoffish it was difficult to imagine them taking the initiative like that. When the two of them worked together, Debug would always make sure to stay an arm's length away, make sure they never accidentally bumped into one another. She had been so unable to think about how they would start it that she just skipped to the deed and got put off.

But that might be part of the problem.

How had she ended up getting intimate with her past boyfriends at all? She knew it was a pain at the end of their relationship, but she wouldn't have dated them for as long if it was unpleasant the whole time. 

If Debug wasn't as skittish, if they had the confidence to face her like she knew was possible for them to, how would they do it?

Would it be at work? That seemed to be where she was most out going. They had said they looked forward to working together, but also the handover. If the two of them were behind the reception desk, and both reached for a key at the same time? Debug would snatch it and try to hold it out of her reach, like the sneakthief they loved to be. But they can't hide in the narrow space around the desk, nor keep anything out of her reach. Brun would grab their hand, and pin it to the wall to loom over Dee. Because they trust her, they would keep acting like it was a game. But she would need to make sure they knew how serious they could be. With her free arm, she would grip their chin, force them to look up, show them what they could do with those pretty lips and...

"Oh no...I want to fuck my friend." Brun shouted. "How did I go from being afraid she might do something to wanting to do her?"

Brun stood back up, unlocked Trouble's room door and strode back in, turning on the overhead lights to their dim setting so she could find her friend.

Trouble wasn't difficult to find, they had ended up on the ground next to the bed and was sobbing quietly. She quietly picked Trouble up in her arms and rather than put them back down on the bed, since this was the second time tonight they had fallen off, walked over and sat down on the armchair with Trouble curled up in a ball in her lap. 

They sat in silence Brun petting the form in her lap, Trouble started to relax and doze off while Brun tried to have more dirty thoughts. 

"What was so different about that than when I was imagining stuff before?" She mused. "Also, I missed. How did I miss? I tried to imagine Debug coming for me, and instead I..." In the utter darkness she knew she was blushing but was glad no one could see.
