Brun had been running her mind ragged the last week trying to work out what was wrong with herself. Maybe she just needed to be attacked to see clearly.

Mere moments ago Trouble had been all over her, plastering her with kiss after kiss. But despite how her imagination had warned it had been fine, pleasant even. She wasn't scared or worried, if not for her concern about why Trouble had seemed so upset it had felt fun to let them attack her. 

But that made no sense. 

Even now, if she thought back and imagined her last boyfriend, Chet, with his toned muscles and big hands and leering eyes, the notion of letting him touch her turned her stomach. But she wasn't opposed to guys, if she imagined that Trouble was packing a trouser snake she would have felt pleased all the same. 

Putting that aside, she tried to do what Trouble had yelled at her and imagined Debug trying to make a pass at her. This had been part of her problem all week, because Debug was so standoffish it was difficult to imagine them taking the initiative like that. When the two of them worked together, Debug would always make sure to stay an arm's length away, make sure they never accidentally bumped into one another. She had been so unable to think about how they would start it that she just skipped to the deed and got put off.

But that might be part of the problem.

How had she ended up getting intimate with her past boyfriends at all? She knew it was a pain at the end of their relationship, but she wouldn't have dated them for as long if it was unpleasant the whole time. 

If Debug wasn't as skittish, if they had the confidence to face her like she knew was possible for them to, how would they do it?

Would it be at work? That seemed to be where she was most outgoing. Debug had said she looked forward to working together, but also doing the handovers. If the two of them were behind the reception desk, and both reached for a key at the same time? Debug would snatch it and try to hold it out of her reach, like the sneakthief she loved to be. But they can't hide in the narrow space around the desk, nor keep anything out of her reach being as short as they are. Brun would grab their hand, and pin it to the wall to loom over her. Because she trusts Brun, they would keep acting like it was a game. But Brun would need to make sure they knew how serious they could be. 

With a free arm, she would grip their chin, force them to look up, show them what they could do with those pretty lips and...

"Oh no...I want to fuck my friend." Brun shouted. "How did I go from being afraid she might do something to wanting to do her?"

Brun stood back up, unlocked Trouble's room door and strode back in, turning on the overhead lights to their dim setting so she could find her friend.

Trouble wasn't difficult to find, they had ended up on the ground next to the bed and were sobbing quietly. She quietly scooped Trouble back up into her arms again and rather than put them back down on the bed, since this was the second time tonight they had fallen off, walked over and sat down on the armchair together settling Trouble on top of her.

They sat in silence Brun petting the form in her lap, their head resting on her chest. Trouble started to relax and doze off while Brun tried to have more dirty thoughts. 

"What was so different about that than when I was imagining stuff before?" She mused. "Also, I missed. How did I miss? I tried to imagine Debug coming for me, and instead I..." In the utter darkness she knew she was blushing but was glad no one could see. "Maybe it's cause they're too cheeky, how can I get them to take the lead?" 

Brun's mind cast back and immediately landed on Trouble kneeling over them and giving them attention like an enthusiastic puppy. She wasn't sure why they had gotten so upset about the whole situation. Sure, she had expected some pushback, maybe Trouble getting upset with her if she had talked about something as frivolous as sex and kissing with someone who'd been abused in related acts.

Instead she had gotten up in her face and scolded her for talking poorly of herself and saying that kisses weren't an option among friends.

Brun tried to comprehend the idea of being worth getting mad on her behalf. It just felt wrong, like trying to spell a word without vowels: it would be possible but inherently wrong.

"If it's so fine, then kiss me." Brun repeating what Trouble had said minutes ago. She looked down at the sleeping puppy in her lap, their face serene and calm compared to how exhausted and upset they had looked when they woke up. The same, now mostly dried, streaks of tears still shone on their face, cutting into the layer of makeup on their cheek. Brun rubbed a thumb along the dried rivers, streaking the damp makeup and revealing some of Trouble's last bruises that had yet to fade.

"You were so upset of my thinking poorly of myself, I'd never seen you that angry. Why can you get angry for my sake but not your own?" Brun leaned her head down as far as she could and could only just put her lips on the top of Trouble's head. "I don't think this is what you meant when you said to kiss you."

Brun did wonder how she would kiss Trouble. They were as short as Dee, so any intimate moment would be spoiled by Brun looming tall over the whole situation. But from how she had proven time after time, she could pick them up like a delicate doll. What's to stop her from having her way with her Princess once she was trapped in her arms.

She could hold them like now, in the crook of her arm. With her free hand, purposefully running her finger tips from hip up to their chest. The buttons on Trouble's shirt, spots of cold under her fingers, yielding to a small bit of pressure. She now had access to the delicate skin underneath. The tiny fuzz of body hair resisting her touch and tickling her palm as she spread her fingers wide on Trouble's stomach. 

Their calm heartbeat under her hand.

As she dropped her hand lower she found their hip bone, sticking out against the flat expanse of their torso. Brun hadn't taken a particularly long look at Trouble when she had first seen them naked and now regretted her unfamiliarity with her friend's body.

Brun's breath quickened, the excitement of thinking about her friend starting to get to her.

Her hand grazed against one of the bandages.

Brun opened her eyes.

Her hand was all the way inside Trouble's shirt.

She'd not been imagining anything.

Her guts felt like they were trying to contain hundreds of butterflies. She couldn't stop feeling the excitement, the thrill of the physical closeness. But this was exactly the sort of thing she had been dreading happening to her.

Brun retrieved her hand and put it back on Trouble's cheek.

"Love, wake up, I need to ask you something." Brun whispered, half not wanting Trouble to wake up and the rest giddy with excitement. "If you wake up I'll give you a kiss."

Trouble stirred and looked up at Brun, once their eyes locked Trouble reached up a hand to mirror Brun and caress their cheek sleepily. They stretched their body and neck to raise their lips to meet Brun's as through doing such a thing was the most normal thing in the world.

Trouble held the kiss for longer than Brun could count, her heart hammering hard enough she was sure Trouble could feel it. For how rough so many parts of Trouble looked from all her cuts and bruises, her lips were very soft.

Trouble moved their hand, hooking around Brun's neck and keeping them close. For a heart retching moment, Brun through Trouble was done and they were going to break the kiss, she didn't realize how much fun she was having and how desperately she didn't want this to stop, she'd not even tried laying her hands on Trouble now she was awake. But as Trouble deepened the kiss and leaned harder into Brun's chest they started pulling down on Brun's neck as though dragging her deeper into the lust coloured haze that was filling her mind.

Trouble tried to run their hands through Brun's hair and ran into the problem that to keep all her braids in a neat bun they were all quite taught and didn't have the slack to let fingers in. For some reason that complication broke her focus and the kiss finally broke, a line of saliva still connected their lips as they panted at one another.

"Princess?" Trouble asked, her words almost slurred as her eyes darted about taking everything in. 

Brun's heart stopped.

Had she made a mistake? She had essentially woken Trouble up with a kiss, she thought it was what she wanted. But did they even know what was going on?

They had plastered her with several before.

Had they confused her for someone else? Mere minutes ago they'd confused Brun for their abusive boyfriend so it was very possible.

Brun helped Trouble to their feet and tried to find the words to talk about what had just happened.

She couldn't see what sort of expression they had, but could see what looked like wet pleading eyes looking at her from the darkness asking for an answer.

Was she becoming the same thing she had spent the last few weeks afraid of? Did she just assault her friend in her lust addled confusion? Did she trick Trouble into a situation she couldn't agree to? 

Trying to get off the topic and talk about anything else, Brun tried to divert both of their attention elsewhere.

"Beth said Dee might be in trouble."

"In me?" Trouble asked, clearly confused and half asleep.

"No, like danger. I don't think anyone's seen her since you two came back from your night out. Beth was at her house and I think she said it looked abandoned." Brun tried to keep her emotions under control, unsure what Trouble could see.

"We did see her mom while we were out I think. She don't seem to like talking to them, it was the most upset I've ever seen her." Trouble chirped up, Brun was unsure how to handle their moving on so quickly from her assault and committed to not bringing up what she'd done until Trouble was ready. "When is her next shift, she still needs to work right?"

Brun nodded and strode to the door, her chest felt tight as she decided to not take Trouble's hand as they both headed out the door.

***

Trouble was having a hard time taking the current situation seriously.

What Brun had said did sound serious, but all she had running through her head was the feeling of being wrapped in Brun's arms and waking up somehow already kissing.

How could she have missed the most important part? Where she found out that Brun was gay.

Trouble came to a sudden stop, almost tumbling over. Brun kept walking, so she was unable to stand still while she combed through her memories. Brun had mentioned having boyfriends before, and they had kissed just her. But gay people didn't have boyfriends...except she had also had a boyfriend. 

Trouble knew she was still sleep addled, but her mind was doing it's best to come to terms with if she could be confident that wasn't just a very wonderful one-of-a-kind kiss. Could she just ask Brun for a second one to compare? She couldn't actually be that selfish, but it would be fine to imagine. 

As they got to the reception Trouble recognised one of the two people behind the desk as Daveo, the chef who kept trying to sneak fruit onto her plate when she ate in the dining area.

Brun nodded at the person wearing the reception staff uniform and pushed Daveo's head against the wall in an oddly playful manner.

"Hollow, just as I expected." Brun taunted.

"Two to one odds you can't do bring yourself to do that to your small friend here." Daveo bit back. "Get your twenty bucks back if you've got the nerve."

Brun beckoned Trouble to join the three of them behind the desk.

Trying to not look as small as possible like her instincts where shouting at her to do, Trouble walked and stood next to Brun, unsure if they might actually hurt her.

Brun suddenly lent against the wall next to Trouble's head making her jump, their arm wrapping around her head from the side to the top. Brun leant in and gave Trouble a gentle light kiss on their forehead and then using their chin pushed her head against the wall so that it makes a small bonk noise.

There was a moment of tense silence.

"Okay, thirty bucks if you do the same thing to me." Daveo said, eyes lighting up like he'd just discovered a new toy.

"I'm done with kisses now, it's just biting from here on. And I only do services for guests, you're out of luck Daveo. Maybe ask Guy here if he'll be your partner." Brun pointed a thumb at the concierge staff who was turning incredibly red and was somehow both unable to look at and keep their eyes off Daveo. "Anyway. Come on Trouble, the roster is here."

Brun lead Trouble further into the back room, somewhere she'd spent very little time despite Bug inviting Trouble to sit with her while she worked every weekend. With the practice of someone who knew their way around a space they managed to wade through the narrow room and it's multitude of knee high cabinates and bent at the hips to do something with the computer. Trouble couldn't tell what Brun was doing as she couldn't take her eyes of their bum.

Brun had been the picture of stoic and serious until tonight, she couldn't even fathom thinking about her like this. But the longer she gazed at the perfectly round bum on the lady in front of her the brighter the memory of Brun standing frozen wearing naught but two hard working towels burned in her mind. She could see it so vividly: the droplets of water glistening and beading down her perfect skin.

"Trouble?" Brun's voice broke through her stupor.

"Please." Trouble's mouth said before she knew what was going on.

"What?"

"Who said that?"

"...I said Dee's been taken off the roster."

"What?" Trouble's mind ground to a halt as Brun's words fell like a wrench amongst her mind's gears.

"Dee's not on the roster. She's no anywhere." Brun pointed at the screen, Trouble craning her neck to see around her friends rear. "Well she is still in a few systems, but if she had left on her own terms she would have deleted or changed the admin accounts she had all over the system." Brun stood back up to her full height and grabbed Trouble. "I don't know what's happening any more. But I think something is wrong."
