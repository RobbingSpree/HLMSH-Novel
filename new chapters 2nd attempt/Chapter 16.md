Brun had been running her mind ragged the last week trying to work out what was wrong with herself. Maybe she just needed to be attacked to see clearly.

Mere moments ago Trouble had been all over her, plastering her with kiss after kiss. But despite how her imagination had warned it had been fine, pleasant even. She wasn't scared or worried, if not for her concern about why Trouble had seemed so upset it had felt fun to let them attack her. 

But that made no sense. 

Even now, if she thought back and imagined her last boyfriend, Chet, with his toned muscles and big hands and leering eyes, the notion of letting him touch her turned her stomach. But she wasn't opposed to guys, if she imagined that Trouble was packing a trouser snake she would have felt the same. 

Putting that aside, she tried to do what Trouble had yelled at her and imagined Debug trying to make a pass at her. This had been part of her problem all week, because Debug was so standoffish it was difficult to imagine them taking the initiative like that. When the two of them worked together, Debug would always make sure to stay an arm's length away, make sure they never accidentally bumped into one another. She had been so unable to think about how they would start it that she just skipped to the deed and got put off.

But that might be part of the problem.

How had she ended up getting intimate with her past boyfriends at all? She knew it was a pain at the end of their relationship, but she wouldn't have dated them for as long if it was unpleasant the whole time. 

If Debug wasn't as skittish, if they had the confidence to face her like she knew was possible for them to, how would they do it?

Would it be at work? That seemed to be where she was most outgoing. She had said she looked forward to working together, but also doing the handovers. If the two of them were behind the reception desk, and both reached for a key at the same time? Debug would snatch it and try to hold it out of her reach, like the sneakthief she loved to be. But they can't hide in the narrow space around the desk, nor keep anything out of her reach being as short as they are. Brun would grab their hand, and pin it to the wall to loom over her. Because she trusts Brun, they would keep acting like it was a game. But Brun would need to make sure they knew how serious they could be. 

With a free arm, she would grip their chin, force them to look up, show them what they could do with those pretty lips and...

"Oh no...I want to fuck my friend." Brun shouted. "How did I go from being afraid she might do something to wanting to do her?"

Brun stood back up, unlocked Trouble's room door and strode back in, turning on the overhead lights to their dim setting so she could find her friend.

Trouble wasn't difficult to find, they had ended up on the ground next to the bed and was sobbing quietly. She quietly picked Trouble up in her arms and rather than put them back down on the bed, since this was the second time tonight they had fallen off, walked over and sat down on the armchair with Trouble curled up in a ball in her lap. 

They sat in silence Brun petting the form in her lap, their head resting on her chest. Trouble started to relax and doze off while Brun tried to have more dirty thoughts. 

"What was so different about that than when I was imagining stuff before?" She mused. "Also, I missed. How did I miss? I tried to imagine Debug coming for me, and instead I..." In the utter darkness she knew she was blushing but was glad no one could see. "Maybe it's cause they're too cheeky, how can I get them to take the lead?" 

Brun's mind cast back and immediately landed on Trouble kneeling over them and giving them attention like an enthusiastic puppy. She wasn't sure why they had gotten so upset about the whole situation. Sure, she had expected some pushback, maybe Trouble getting upset if she had talked about something as frivolous as sex and kissing with someone who'd been abused by the sort of person she would expect those things from.

Instead she had gotten up in her face and scolded her for thinking poorly of herself. 

"If it's so fine, then kiss me." Brun muttered, repeating what Trouble had said minutes ago. She looked down at the sleeping puppy in her lap, it's face serene and calm compared to how exhausted and upset they had looked when they woke up. The same, now mostly dried, streaks of tears still shone on their face, cutting into the layer of makeup on Trouble's cheek. Brun rubbed a thumb along the dried rivers, streaking the damp makeup and revealing some of Trouble's last bruises that had yet to fade.

"You were so upset of my thinking poorly of my looks, I'd never seen you that angry. Why can you get angry for my sake but not your own?" Brun leaned her head down as far as she could and could only just put her lips on the top of Trouble's head. "I don't think this is what you meant when you said to kiss you."

Brun did wonder how she would kiss Trouble. They were as short as Dee, so any intimate moment would be spoiled by Brun looming tall over the whole situation. But from how she had proven time after time, she could pick them up like a delicate puppy. What's to stop her from having her way with her Princess once she was trapped in her arms.

She could hold them like now, in the crook of her arm. With her free hand, delicately run her finger tips from their hip up to their chest. The buttons on Trouble's shirt, spots of cold under the fingers, yielding to a small bit of pressure. She now had access to the delicate skin underneath. She could feel the tiny fuzz of body hair resisting her touch as she spread her fingers wide on Trouble's stomach. 

Their calm heartbeat under her hand.

As she dropped her hand lower she found their hip bone, sticking out against the flat expanse of their body. Brun hadn't taken a particularly long look at Trouble when she had first seen them naked and now regretted her unfamiliarity with her friend's body.

Brun's breath quickened, the excitement of thinking about her friend starting to get to her.

Her hand grazed against one of the bandaged.

Brun opened her eyes.

Her hand was all the way inside Trouble's shirt.

She'd not been imagining anything.

Her guts felt like they were trying to contain hundreds of butterflies. She couldn't stop feeling the excitement, the thrill of the physical closeness. But this was exactly the sort of thing she had been dreading happening to her.

Brun retrieved her hand and put it back on Trouble's cheek.

"Love, wake up, I need to ask you something." Brun whispered, half not wanting Trouble to wake up and the rest giddy with excitement. "If you wake up I'll give you a kiss."

Trouble stirred and looked up at Brun, once their eyes locked Trouble reached up a hand to mirror Brun and caress their cheek also. They stretched their body and neck to raise their lips to meet Brun's as through doing such a thing was the most normal thing in the world.

Trouble held the kiss for longer than Brun could count, her heart hammering hard enough she was sure Trouble could feel it. For how rough so many parts of Trouble looked from all her cuts and bruises, her lips were very soft.

Trouble moved their hand, hooking around Brun's neck and keeping them close. For a heart renching moment, Brun through Trouble was done and they were going to break the kiss, she didn't realise how much fun she was having and she'd not even tried using her hands again. But as Trouble deepened the kiss and leaned harder into Brun's chest they started pulling down on Brun's neck as though dragging her deeper into the lust filled haze that was filling her mind.

Trouble tried to run their hands through Brun's hair and ran into the problem that to keep all her braids in a neat bun they were all quite taught and didn't have the slack to let fingers in. For some reason that complexity
