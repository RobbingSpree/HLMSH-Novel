## Stuff from beta readers:

### Piamo
Chapter 1:
-    I feel like the riskiness of the escape section could be heightened by revealing some information through dialogue. Ex) Paragraph 2. If you ended that paragraph with “Felicity didn’t trust him to stay loud and harmless for long” and then went right to a Frank dialogue, it would up the tension, because the reader isn’t given all the information at once about Frank being an abuser. So basically bringing the reader up to speed a bit more gradually, in line with Felicity’s own thought process. You could also hide the abuse, leaving hints only with Felicity’s thought process (eg. fixating on the door being not locked for once) and then the first real confirmation is Brun’s acknowledgment of Felicity’s bruises, rather than Felicity being the one to bring the bruises up to the reader. A tinge of unreliable narrator, through omission
-    Tension does drop a bit with the POV shift, but I think only because the connectivity between the two POVs is almost exact. That is, we see Felicity find the hotel, and then we cut to Brun in the hotel, almost like we’re seeing the same scene from the other side. There’s little room for speculation. It could be you could leave out the part about Felicity finding the hotel, making it more uncertain where she is headed. Then, when the reader is in Brun’s perspective, the reader is also wondering “wait, is that Felicity?” and can intuit the fact that she wandered around until she found the hotel. Basically, making the reader work a bit more.
-    Tension did not quite raise for me when Brun and Felicity meet, but I think that would be addressed with the above two points. That is, if I was piecing together Felicity’s domestic abuse situation along with Brun, I might be more engaged. It would be nice to see maybe more hints of Brun having a goal. You mentioned her being interested in small animals (I like this parallel a lot with Felicity), you could even have her secretly bringing food to work to feed the animals (so its more of an active thing, rather than a passive thing the narration is telling us).

Chapter 2:
-    I definitely got the impression that Brun is getting something about of being a rescuer here, rather than taking Felicity to the hospital, which I found interesting. I didn’t catch the concussion part specifically though.
-    I feel like I understand Brun and Felicity more on a thematic level, although “Did she feel safe only because {small animals} didn’t talk much?” I feel like this might be a bit too early/on the nose. I would rather piece it together for myself. I think my issue with the characters is possibly not feeling much of an emotional connection to them yet? Like as an example, if Beth had been like “Trouble? Wasn’t that the name you gave that old cat of yours?” “No,” Brun lied. Idk something like that, it would make the world (and characters) feel like they exist beyond this scene.
-    My impressions: Brun feels like a rescuer, but someone who maybe feels a bit too good having power over another (I mean this positively) (I also clocked the violence with which she opened the door to the room). She strikes me as scatterbrained. Felicity is meanwhile the “perfect” victim. Lacking in self-assuredness and timid. At least on the surface...

Chapter 3: 
-    The movement descriptions make sense, but at times what the narrative focuses on causes me to lose interest. For example, in Chapter 1, there was a lot of description about Felicity in the storm that I felt like could have been collapsed a bit. Another example, in Chapter 2, “Are you up for a quick walk? I have something to show you” there is more description about the logistics of helping Felicity stand, but I felt like all that could have been cut, so we get that single line of dialogue and then cut to them walking. Basically, not describing every movement beat for beat. 
-    Re: their assumptions about each other, yes I can tell. It’s muddied a bit by my lack of connection to the characters (which I mentioned might be helped by adding a bit more specificity) but overall I think the foundation is there for a very interesting case of misunderstanding and projection. 
-    I enjoyed Felicity taking on the name Trouble, it made sense to me. She’s ceding her name to a name (and identity) that Brun gave her, which makes her seem all the more submissive. Also I want to note that the conversation between Brun and Felicity regarding the towel (at the very end of the chapter) was my favorite part. The characters felt very alive there, their interaction very natural and engaging.

Other random notes:
- I didn't feel like the prose was rushing, in fact it felt a bit slow at times. Not to say "going faster" is the answer (pacing is hard to explain), but I mentioned in a few places possibly condensing some of the logistics. Then again, I'm a writer who tends to write compressed stories, describing only what is absolutely necessary, so this is possibly a taste thing. 
- Clarity was fine, the thing I struggled with the most was staying interested, but again, I'm a reader who likes to piece things together for myself, so I am biased towards scenes where I can read between the lines. There is definitely some of that there! But I think the story is ripe for tension, and it can be pushed further
