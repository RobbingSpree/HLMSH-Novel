Her Love Makes Safe Harbor
A romance novel by Bobbity Obbity

Currently a work in progress and visible for proof-reading before I post it online to get general feedback.

The first draft of the chapters that have been abandoned are present and the newxt draft will follow the same general plot.
But I found issues with forgetting to keep track of what time of day it was and speeding through scenes making for a bit of an ephemeral story.
So I've started fresh, writing from chapter 1 again.

Current length of rehash:
3000-ish words
1 chapter

Latest posted chapter:
None
