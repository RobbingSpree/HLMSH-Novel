Her Love Makes Safe Harbor
A romance novel by Bobbity Obbity

Currently a work in progress and visible for proof-reading before I post it online to get general feedback.

The [first draft of the chapters that have been abandoned](https://github.com/RobbingSpree/HLMSH-Novel/blob/main/chapters_as_imported/Chapter0.md) are present and the next draft will follow the same general plot. 
But I found issues with forgetting to keep track of what time of day it was and speeding through scenes making for a bit of an ephemeral story.
So I've started fresh, [writing from chapter 1](https://github.com/RobbingSpree/HLMSH-Novel/blob/main/new%20chapters%202nd%20attempt/Chapter%201.md) again.

Current length of rehash:

act 1 publishing complete (10 chapters) 27000-ish words
- 10 chapter(s) complete. (1-10)
- Intermission 1 complete (1)
act 2 writing in progress 13000-ish words
- 2 chapters complete (11-12)
- 5 chapter in editing hell (13-16, + intermission 2)
- 1 chapter being written (17)

Total length: 42,000-ish words

Synopsis:

Brunhilde loves small and delicate critters, when she meets a battered woman in need that she can only describe as small and delicate, her desire to protect takes over and she gives them shelter at the hotel she works at.
Felicity assumes it's only natural that everyone seems to mistreat her until she meets a tall, brooding woman who takes care of her like a knight in shining armor.
Debug has been trying to keep her colleagues at arms length assuming the worst, she harmlessly flirts with her work friend Bee and diverts her manager from probing her past, but meeting a fellow survivor in Trouble opens her to the possibility of letting people in.
