Her Love Makes Safe Harbor
A romance novel by Bobbity Obbity

Currently a work in progress and visible for proof-reading before I post it online to get general feedback.

The [first draft of the chapters that have been abandoned](https://github.com/RobbingSpree/HLMSH-Novel/blob/main/chapters_as_imported/Chapter0.md) are present and the next draft will follow the same general plot. 
But I found issues with forgetting to keep track of what time of day it was and speeding through scenes making for a bit of an ephemeral story.
So I've started fresh, [writing from chapter 1](https://github.com/RobbingSpree/HLMSH-Novel/blob/main/new%20chapters%202nd%20attempt/Chapter%201.md) again.

Current length of rehash:
16000-ish words
- 2 chapter(s) complete. (1-2)
- 1 chapter pending upload (3)
- 3 chapter in editing hell (4-6)
- 1 chapter being written (7)
- 2 in pre-production planning (7-8)

Debug has been trying to keep her colleagues at arms length assuming the worst, she harmlessly flirts with her work friend Bee and diverts her manager from probing her past, but meeting a fellow survivor in Trouble opens her to the desire to wanting to try letting people in.
