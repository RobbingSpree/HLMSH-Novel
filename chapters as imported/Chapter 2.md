Ten minutes later and Felicity had become quite engrossed in a book Brunhilde had left tucked into the chair. The noise of running water from the shower in the adjacent room was making for wonderful white noise, drowning out all chance of distraction.

The noise of the water cut off.

Felicity tried to refocus on her book.

She could hear the sounds of wet footsteps and flapping fabric now.

She was getting to a rather interesting bit about how some of the early video game programmers had been plagued by nightmares about the circumstances portrayed in their very basic game. But her focus finally yielded when the door to the shower surreptitiously squeaked while slowly opening.

Felicity looked up from her book, eyes drawn to the source of the noise.

Brunhilde was tip toeing across the room.

A very small towel was held up, covering her bust.

A slightly more generous silk wrap was tied around her hips.

The silk wrap being slightly transparent did nothing to hide her body underneath.

Felicity found herself unable to look away.

Brunhilde's skin glistened with stray water droplets.

The silk clung to her body, held close my the residual damp.

Brunhilde froze like a deer in Felicity's headlights.

From where she stood Brunhilde dove into a different room that Felicity assumed was the bedroom. All Felicity saw was a flash of movement as Brunhilde tumbled away.

"I forgot to leave myself a change of clothes." Came Brunhilde's voice from the still open doorway.

"That was an amazing leap." Felicity replied while she wondered if acrobatics was a required part of hotel concierge.

"That's the loudest I've heard you speak." Brunhilde's head said as it popped back into view, the rest of her body still hidden. "If I keep feeding you books I wonder if I'll be able to hear your delightful voice more often." Her head vanished again back into the room.

"The book helped. And so did the chair." Felicity tried to snuggle deeper into the soft chair and Brunhilde's raincoat she was still wearing.

***

Brun swiftly threw on whatever clothes she had lying on the floor in her room. Her face felt warm either from the shower or from the embarrassment of diving out of view when she was caught walking naked back to her apartment.

She had almost forgot she had Trouble sitting in her loungeroom. Brun was too used to strolling around her apartment after a shower buck naked, letting her body air dry. She'd had poor results in the past when people saw her body without the shapewear she wore under her clothes, echoes of snide comments about how she didn't look feminine swam out of her memories.

Shaking her head to dismiss those thoughts, she strode back into the loungeroom now she had become presentable.

"OK, small one. As much as I want to stay up and chill, I do need a nap before I start acting like a loon." Brun said as they released their hair from the shower cap and then the bun it'd been in all day. "If you're feeling up to it though, I'm happy to hear anything you want to share about what brought you to the hotel yesterday or any other details about yourself."

Brun watched as Felicity visibly bristled as she thought about her troubles.

"My boyfriend..." Felicity started, her voice a lot quieter now. Speaking as though she was trying to keep what she said a secret. "...had some disagreements with me. So I left." Brun did her best to maintain eye contact and not look at the splotches of black and blue bruises on Felicity's face nor think about what the rest of her body had looked like last night. Realizing she was imagining Felicity naked, she tried even harder to keep a neutral face.

"It might not seem like it, cause I'm about to go to sleep, but I will do everything I can to keep you safe, small one." Brun said as she walked back to her bedroom. "You've the run of the house, and since I sleep like a log, if you get lonely you can come sit in the bed with me." She gave a wave as she left the room before collapsing dramatically on her bed and getting comfortable. The last thing she did before committing to sleep was make sure both her alarm and backup alarm were on.

***

Felicity was proud she had avoided crying while talking to Brun. She hadn't said much, but it was the first time, possibly ever, she had admitted there was a problem.

Under the raincoat she still had on, was only her tank top with a built in shelf bra. Before the clouds had burst with the first serious storm of spring, it had been an outrageously humid day. And while doing graphic design work from home was normally fine if it was hot, her AC could only handle so much humidity before it functionally started putting fog indoors.

Felicity wasn't keen to leave her arms exposed.

Not just because she found the bruises on them unsightly, but Frank, her boyfriend, also got upset by them. The contradiction of him being the cause of them and getting upset at the sight of them was not lost on Felicity. And she could normally dress comfortably until he came home late, but yesterday he'd gotten home unusually early and she had been caught unprepared.

But dismissing those thoughts, and some extra thoughts she had of Brunhilde's powerful arms and thighs, she settled back in to read some more books. Problems were for later, now was for rest.

***

Brun awoke to her full set of alarms blaring and what felt like an earthquake. As her grogginess failed to clear, her mind slowly connected the dots and remembered she had left her ward in the other room.

Grasping the arm that was shaking her, Brun pulled herself up into a sitting position. Once upright the urge to continue sleeping struck with it's full force. Her head flopped forward and came to rest on Trouble's shoulder. Her delicate shoulder felt comfortable and cool on Brun's face, it was just the right size to snuggle into and support her head and neck.

"You're the best, Trouble." Brun mumbled into Felicity's neck.

"Brunhilde, your alarms have been going off for almost ten minutes now, do you need to be somewhere?"

"Shh." Brun placed a finger somewhere near Felicity's lips. "Only my mom calls me Brunhilde, we're friends now, so you should call me..." moving her arm had upset the delicate balance and Brun slid sideways ending up face down next to where Felicity was kneeling on the bed.

The fall knocked enough of the sleep sticking to Brun's brain loose that she worked out what was going on and pulled herself into a yoga pose Brun didn't know the name of with her legs tucked under her torso and arms stretched forward.

"Work! Where I need to go is work. Can you drag me off the bed? My mattress does its job too well." Brun asked, muffled somewhat by the mattress she was speaking directly into.

Felicity's delicate, long fingers grasped her forearms and dragged her off the bed with a slow thump. No longer in the warm embrace of her bed the reality of her situation set in.

"Do you know what the time is?" Brun asked no one in particular, but hoped Felicity knew the answer.

"Just past midday." Felicity's voice answered, Brun smiled at how clear and stable her voice sounded compared to most of what she had heard until now. Felicity's voice was a lot smoother and nicer to listen to than her own husky tones.

"Ok, I've got time, but not much." Brun grunted, climbing up onto all fours. Making many undignified noises, Brun got to her feet, leaning on Felicity as her legs finished waking up.

"Did you eat while I was asleep? If not i can quickly cook something." She looked at Felicity only to see a small smile on her face, Brun felt a little silly about how poorly she handled waking up. Two alarms hadn't been enough today, a third might be in order.

"I'd be happy to eat more of your cooking." Felicity replied as the two walked back into the larger room. Felicity resumed her vigil in the reading nook and Brun walked around the kitchen island to start gathering ingredients and robotically preparing to cook.

Guided by muscle memory and habit Brun's hands sought out an onion to dice, a knife to dice with, a cup for juice, a second cup (also for juice, but this one for Trouble), oil for the pan, the pan for the oil, the knob to turn on the hotplate, the pan again (this time for the hotplate), the oil now going into the pan, and so on.

With food beginning to make smells in the pan, Brun turned to grab juice from the fridge and put it on the bench. Mechanically she sought out where she'd left a cup and pulled it over to her. Filling it with juice, she turned to put the juice away before remembering she had got a second cup out for Trouble.

Brun turned back and repeated the same motions.

Putting down the juice. Seeking out the cup. Pulling it over to in front of where she did all her prep. Punching the cup that was already there and knocking it clear off the bench.

Time seemed to hang for a moment while Brun caught up to what just happened.

The only thought that went through her head was that she could throw the other glass cup she was holding to try and knock the in-flight cup away from a surface it would shatter on.

But as she thought that the sound of glass shattering brought Brun back to the present and sobered her entirely up.

Brun's eyes snapped over to Felicity to check she was clear of the debris of the glass.

Brun's heart fell out the bottom of her chest.

The look on Felicity's face.

Brun couldn't describe it.

But it hurt to see.

The fear that had sent her out into a small hurricane-like storm yesterday.

Brun could see the shadow of that fear in her face.

Ignoring the broken glass and killing the hotplate, Brun went the other way around the kitchen island and strode over to Felicity in the reading nook.

Scooping her into her arms, Brun sat down in the nook chair and placed Felicity in her lap. Holding the fragile lady close to her chest and murmuring how things were OK and it was an accident. She fell into a rhythm of stroking Trouble's hair and saying whatever nice thing popped into her head.

Time passed.

Brunhilde realized she was starting to drift back into a doze and might nap if she didn't do something else. She paid closer attention to the lady in her arms to see how she was handling her efforts.

Felicity was asleep. Tear stains marked freshly dried rivers down her cheeks. But she seemed at peace where she was.

Brun now had a new problem she had no experience with but had heard other people complain about. She had what could be charitably described as a cat taking a nap in her lap and a chore that required not having a kitten in her lap to complete. The sudden empathy for people she had previously been bewildered by their inability to simply leave was possibly the most surprising part of her "morning".

"The stove is still on." Brun spoke aloud as she remembered what she was doing before. The chance for a delicate escape wasn't possible, a house fire wasn't something she could allow.

As quick as her muscles allowed, Brun stood up. Walked over to the kitchen while still holding Trouble, as that was easier than trying to find a way to extracate herself. And freed a hand from holding her ward to turn the stove off only to find it already dead cold. The food that had made it into the pan looked like it was saturated in oil.

"I dont want to cook that..." Brun said while heaving a sigh "Cereal it is." Brun announced to the sleeping lady in her arms.

***

Felicity awoke to a cold sensation on her arm.

Tensing up, her eyes darted around the room.
 
She recognized what had happened and started trying to relax the tension out of her limbs. Then, she pushed herself into a more upright sitting position and took the bowl of cereal from Brunhilde that had moments earlier been pressed against her arm to wake her.

"Your cooking is very impressive." Felicity quipped before she started scooping mouthfuls of cereal into her mouth.

"I apparently don't do my best work while half asleep." Brunhilde said through a mouthful of food. Felicity noticed Brunhilde was dressed for work again and thought about what she was going to do about her own job, but those thoughts were re quickly dropped when Brunhilde set down her bowl and started getting ready to leave.

"OK, so we'll be heading back to work in a sec." Brunhilde started as she walked around the apartment gathering trinkets she might need and doing a spot of tidying. "You're free to shadow me as I work, we can chat any as long as it doesn't make me look unprofessional. So I may need you to play along if I suddenly start talking about replacing the towels in your room or something."

Felicity nodded while shoveling food frantically into her mouth.

"Hey, cool your jets, cutie. We're not in a rush to go, I just like to be prepared so I can relax before I leave." Brunhilde said as she came over to put a hand on Felicity's shoulder. "I'll let you know when we know what our departure time is, OK?" Felicity felt herself melt a little as Brunhilde softened her voice more and more to reassure her.

As nice as her honeyed words were, Felicity could tell Brunhilde wanted to head out. Her pacing around the room and refusal to sit still while she continued to eat. Felicity struggled to stay calm, the urge to just abandon the food and say she was ready to go too gripped her like an all too familiar guiding hand latched onto her shoulder. As panic started to make knots in her stomach and the feeling of impending harm began to rise, Felicity put the mostly empty bowl down with hands that shook sightly and automatically said.

"Don't worry, I love you, let's go." Felicity's thoughts hung on those words for a few seconds. They had just spilled out without her consent. An automatic chant of placation she had trained herself to say apparently. Rather than walking towards the door she realized she had tried to climb over the other lounge room furniture while her mind was stuck on her own words.

Feeling like she was fighting against her own muscles, Felicity turned to look at Brunhilde. The taller woman's warm tones warmer as her face flushed with embarrassment, and who quickly broke eye contact and tried to make herself busy with fixing her hair back into it's organized mess of a bun.

"Don't worry Trouble, we've both said some queer things this morning while half asleep." Brunhilde said while trying to find herself in the mirror in the bathroom and not look directly at Felicity.

Felicity picked up and donned the raincoat she was given yesterday again from where it had been knocked onto the floor, unsure if the rain was continuing but wanting more of the feeling of protection it had offered her so far. She wandered over to the doorway, still unsure if she should do something about the coats and boots strewn about. Brunhilde quickly came over to tidy it up once she saw where Felicity was waiting.

Brunhilde looked at her, looking like she was trying to find the right words, before simply reaching out and taking Felicity's hand once more, nodding a smile at her and leading her out the front door again.

Brunhilde's hand was warm and comforting. As they waiting, standing in the elevator, Felicity felt panic rise up again, worried that when they reached the ground floor and the doors opened somehow her boyfriend would have found them and claim her once more. As they came to a stop time seemed to stretch, the tension must have become obvious to Brun as she turned to face Felicity and gave her hand a quick kiss.

"I'll keep you safe Trouble, you're in my care now." Brun's words felt like a warm beam of sunlight. Felicity released a breath she didn't know she'd been holding. She didn't like how her boyfriend had treated her like some possession for him to do with what he pleased, but the way Brun's words had sounded like she was claiming Felicity as her own somehow felt different. Kinder. Like a welcome responsibility.

The elevator doors opened behind Brunhilde, giving Felicity her first look at today's sunlight.
