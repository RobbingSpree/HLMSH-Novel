Brun had been running her mind ragged the last week trying to work out what was wrong with herself. Maybe she just needed to be attacked to see clearly.

Mere moments ago Trouble had been all over her, plastering her with kiss after kiss. But despite how her imagination had said it had been fine. She wasn't scared or worried, if not for her concern about why Trouble had seemed so upset it had felt fun to let them attack her. 

But that made no sense. Even now, if she thought back and imagined her last boyfriend with his toned muscles and big hands, the notion of letting him touch her turned her stomach. But she wasn't opposed to guys, if she imagined Trouble was packing she would have felt the same. 

Putting that aside, she tried to do what Trouble had yelled at her and imagined Debug trying to make a pass at her.
