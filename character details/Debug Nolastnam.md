blurb: kidnap and abuse survivor trying to ignore her own past and herself

flaws: 
- jealous of the success others have that she could have if she put herself at risk
- forgets long term plans when they stop actively working on them
- agrees to things in the heat of the moment
- ends up trapping herself when her past is discussed as she both wants to share and is scared to
- is very aware of the personas she puts on with people and that almost every encounter is fake due to not barong her true self

starting point of the story: crushing on coworker, frivolously spending time learning new skills they don't need

Appearance:
pale skin, covered in freckles, yellow undertones
undercut with a flop of hair on top she fidgets with by brushing it to the side, hair is a very dark blue due to dye, actually has the same colour of hair as Felicity she's been saving revealing her hair colour as a cool thing but has forgot why and is now solidly in the habit of dying her hair and eyebrows.
short and wiry, gremlin energy when not in work persona
no visible muscles but tends to use more limbs than necessary to do a job
small bumps of boob
uniform is a size too big, casual clothes are also baggy (to hide the specifics of what their body looks like)
