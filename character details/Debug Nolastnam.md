blurb: kidnap and abuse survivor trying to ignore her own past and herself

flaws: 
- torments self with perceived slights and failures
- 

starting point of the story: crushing on coworker, frivolously spending time learning new skills they don't need

Appearance:
pale skin, covered in freckles, yellow undertones
undercut with a flop of hair on top she fidgets with by brushing it to the side
short and wiry, gremlin energy when not in work persona
no visible muscles but tends to use more limbs than necessary to do a job
small bumps of boob
uniform is a size too big, casual clothes are also baggy (to hide the specifics of what their body looks like)
