## Manager Beth Ahils (pronounced Alice)

Manager of the hotel, likes her current staff and wants to upskill them because she sees the best in them.
Has a bit of a crude sense of humour, but is normally very good at keeping it professional at work.
Reads slutty romance books at work
Tried getting Debug to open up to them by betting they could guess their tragic backstory (debug said they had one as a joking aside and Beth saw it as the cry for help it very much was)
feels entitled to other's attention and time
when she sees Debug being physically intimate with trouble she wants some of that too after watching debug fruitlessly flirt with brun up until now
blackmails debug and assaults them a little
thinks its all in good fun, is wrong

appearance: 
about 40
red shoulder length hair always in a tight bun when at work
has half moon glasses, current frames are also red
pointy chin and thin lips and cutting cheekbones
## ex boyrfrend frank

A wanker abusive jerk who uses their lack of fulfilment in life as an excuse to abuse others. Has been dating Felicity for many years, but as his lack of ambition and lack of interest in self improvement kept causing his mental health to dip he'd take that out on those around him.

## Barry line cook
Absent so far, but from what Brun says in chapter 5, they're kind but harsh

## Daveo line cook
The person Brun mistakes for Barry in chapter 5
