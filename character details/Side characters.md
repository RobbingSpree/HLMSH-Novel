## Manager Beth

Manager of the hotel, likes her current staff and wants to upskill them because she sees the best in them.
Has a bit of a crude sense of humour, but is normally very good at keeping it professional at work.

## ex boyrfrend frank

A wanker abusive jerk who uses their lack of fulfilment in life as an excuse to abuse others. Has been dating Felicity for many years, but as his lack of ambition and lack of interest in self improvement kept causing his mental health to dip he'd take that out on those around him.
